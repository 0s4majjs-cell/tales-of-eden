      "The Berlin Safe Zone is one of the largest surviving urban enclaves in Europe. From a distance it appears as a ring of concrete and alloy, thirty meters high, encircling the ruins of old Berlin.",
      "Inside the walls, life is tightly controlled: ration cards, curfews and loudspeaker announcements that split the day into neat, manageable segments. Most residents never see the sky without concrete framing it.",
      "For people like Alexander Colt, the Safe Zone is both shelter and prison. It keeps the worst of the outside world at bay, but it also cages anyone who wonders what lies beyond the perimeter."

      "Burners appear at first as a shimmer in the air, a distortion like heat rising from asphalt. Instruments struggle to pick them up until something steps inside their radius.",
      "Once triggered, the air within the anomaly instantaneously spikes in temperature, reducing exposed matter to ash and vitrified residue. Protective gear buys seconds at best.",
      "Scavengers who work near Burner fields treat them with a mix of superstition and respect, marking their suspected locations with melted signposts and fused glass rubble."

      "Their operators are trained to treat the world outside as a kill-zone. Anomalies, mutants, unregistered scavengers—if it lives beyond the perimeter it is considered hostile by default.",
      "Karl Ottermand is a former SED-4 specialist who walked away from his posting, choosing exile in the ruins over another year of sanctioned executions."

      "Alexander Colt grew up within the Berlin Safe Zone, surviving on ration lines, static-filled announcements and second-hand stories about the world beyond the walls.",
      "His decision to escape is less a single moment of rebellion and more the slow grind of a life that never changes. When the opportunity finally comes, he takes it without fully understanding the cost.",

    "Officially designated Perimeter Defense Division 74, most residents simply call them PD74. They are the primary armed force responsible for maintaining order within the Berlin Safe Zone and securing the vast ring of concrete and alloy that seals the city from the outside world.",
    "PD74 units patrol the inner districts, the wall-top catwalks and the fractured outskirts where the Safe Zone bleeds into the ruins. Their duties range from curfew enforcement and ration line security to rapid-response deployment whenever something—or someone—tests the integrity of the perimeter.",
    "To the people of Berlin, PD74 is both shield and shadow. They are the ones who step between the Safe Zone and whatever waits beyond the walls, but they are also the boots in the stairwells, the checkpoints at every sector gate and the rifles that make sure no one leaves without permission."
