<p>A shallow hill rolled down to the edge of a lake so still it looked solid from a distance, the surface holding the sky in perfect reflection. Wildflowers grew in scattered patches, nodding gently in the breeze. On the far side, a dark slope of rock rose up, veined with moss and threads of hanging plants. Water spilled down from a gap above, not in a roar but in a steady, clean sheet that broke into spray as it hit the pool below.</p>
<p>Ash stopped at the top of the incline and spread her arms as if she could frame the whole scene between them.</p>
<p>“There,” she said. “Told you it was worth it.”</p>
<p>The words were simple, but her voice had a quiet reverence to it.</p>
<p>Viktor stood beside her, eyes moving across the clearing. The lake. The slope. The waterfall. His brain did what it always did: scanned for movement, cover, sniping positions, places an ambush could be staged.</p>
<p>He found nothing.</p>
<p>Emptiness made him uneasy in a different way.</p>
