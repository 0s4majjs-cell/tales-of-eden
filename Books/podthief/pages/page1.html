<p>Tucked beneath the roots of the Väinölä forests lay Lintukoto—a buried lattice of corridors and chambers cut into rock and metal, humming softly under the weight of the world above it. It was morning on the surface, but no sunlight reached this deep. Down here, time was measured in shifts, status lights, and the slow exhale of ventilation systems.</p>
<p>Ash stood in the pod chamber and let herself be still for a moment.</p>
<p>Condensation beaded on the walls. The air tasted faintly of coolant and sterilizing agents. Her breath left small clouds in front of her face, fading quickly in the chill. The straps of her harness crossed her chest and ribs in a tight grid of webbing, the buckles worn from use. Her loose white pants brushed softly as she shifted her weight, fabric pooling over the tops of her boots.</p>
<p>The pod in front of her hissed as its internal systems cycled. Blue light pulsed behind the glass.</p>
<p>Viktor.</p>
