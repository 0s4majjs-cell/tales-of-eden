Tucked beneath the roots of the Väinölä forests lay Lintukoto—a buried lattice of corridors and chambers cut into rock and metal, humming softly under the weight of the world above it. It was morning on the surface, but no sunlight reached this deep. Down here, time was measured in shifts, status lights, and the slow exhale of ventilation systems.

Ash stood in the pod chamber and let herself be still for a moment.

Condensation beaded on the walls. The air tasted faintly of coolant and sterilizing agents. Her breath left small clouds in front of her face, fading quickly in the chill. The straps of her harness crossed her chest and ribs in a tight grid of webbing, the buckles worn from use. Her loose white pants brushed softly as she shifted her weight, fabric pooling over the tops of her boots.

The pod in front of her hissed as its internal systems cycled. Blue light pulsed behind the glass.

Viktor.

Suspended in that artificial glow, he looked less like a man and more like a machine waiting for activation. Wires fed into the sockets at his prosthetic shoulder, ran along the lines of his spine, disappeared into ports at his ribs and neck. Data cables drooped from the rig above like a cluster of umbilical cords. The armored half-mask sealed over the lower half of his face, hiding his mouth, giving him a permanent, distant silence.

Ash exhaled slowly through her nose.

“Hey,” she said quietly. Her voice sounded small in the room, swallowed by the insulation and machinery. “I’m back.”

Of course he didn’t answer. He was deep in induced sleep, brain activity flattened to a safe, managed minimum. He wouldn’t even hear her.

She stepped closer anyway, until her reflection faintly overlapped his on the glass. Her fingertips rested against the cold surface. The chill bit into her skin, grounding her.

“It’s only been two days,” she murmured, more to herself than to him. “Feels longer.”

It always did. Time stretched differently when he was in the pod—longer, thinner, like something pulled too tight.

She dropped her forehead against the glass for a second, eyes closing. The fatigue she usually joked over pressed at the back of her skull, but she let it pass, swallowed it down, and straightened again.

“Alright,” she said softly. “Let’s get you out.”

Her hands moved to the terminal mounted beside the pod. The interface was smooth and unlabeled, meant for those who were supposed to be here, not for someone like her. But she’d done this often enough that her fingers found the right sequences without thinking. Manual overrides. Hidden service menus. Old access strings she should not have known.

Pavel had started switching the pod models every few months. Different layouts. Different protocols. Different safeguards. Maybe he knew what she was doing. Maybe he was just paranoid in general. Ash never asked. She just adapted.

The lock gave a final, sharp beep. Systems unwound. The lights inside the pod shifted from steady blue to a softer, unstable white.

A crack ribboned down the center of the glass as seals unlatched. Cold vapor rolled out into the chamber with a long, slow hiss. Hydraulic arms disengaged their grips and slid back.

The door opened.

Viktor fell forward under his own weight.

Ash stepped in and caught him around the ribs, bracing her legs. The impact drove the air out of her lungs, but she held. His skin was ice cold under her palms, slick with thawing condensation. He was bare from the waist up, scars cutting pale channels through the wetness, muscles under the surface harder than they looked. He was heavy—too heavy for someone his size—but the metal threaded through his body explained that. And she was no baseline herself.

“I swear you get heavier every time,” she muttered, adjusting her stance, dragging his arm over her shoulders. “You and your upgrades.”

His head lolled against her. His eyes were open now, but unfocused, pupils slow to react to the dim light. A twitch moved through the fingers of his prosthetic hand as the interface ports retracted their needles from his arm.

“Sorry, Vik,” she said, low. “I’m borrowing you.”

She checked the remaining leads, made sure nothing was still connected that could tear free, then eased him clear of the pod. The cryo fog curled around their legs as they moved.

They didn’t take the main hallway.

Lintukoto had been built like a maze on purpose. Labs, ranges, surgical theaters, housing modules, mechanical tunnels and forgotten storage annexes layered on top of one another. There were paths for personnel, paths for equipment, paths for cooling pipes and power conduits. Ash knew the ones that didn’t show up on most schematics.

She half-guided, half-carried Viktor through a side hatch, down a cramped maintenance stair lined with old cables and dust, through a service corridor that smelled of rust and oil. Security nodes blinked in the distance, their sensor cones aimed at the official routes, not here.

If she got caught, Pavel would make good on at least half the threats he’d ever thrown at her. She didn’t bother dwelling on which half.

She’d just break him out again when she healed.

The last door required a physical keycard—older tech, the kind Pavel trusted more than anything wireless. She’d stolen this one months ago and always slipped it back before anyone noticed. Today, it was already in her pocket, like she knew she would need it.

The door opened on a gust of cooler, cleaner air.

Outside.

The surface hit like a change in pressure. The muted buzz of underground vents disappeared, replaced by the subtle hum of the forest—wind threading through high branches, distant calls of birds, the dry scrape of pine needles shifting underfoot. The light was filtered through the canopy in broken beams, moss and underbrush catching it in patches of green.

The door slid shut behind them with a final mechanical click.

Ash adjusted her grip on Viktor, letting him take more of his weight as his legs remembered how to move. The cryo-stiffness fought him, every muscle slow to answer commands, but he stood.

He blinked against the brightness, head turning fractionally as if he were cataloguing the new environment. His expression was almost completely blank. Not the calm of someone at ease, but the flat stillness of someone who had learned to shut everything down.

Ash squeezed his hand.

“I know,” she said softly. “It’s a lot. Just give it a minute.”

He didn’t respond. His gaze tracked across the tree line instead, mapping distances, exits, cover. Habit.

She nudged his shoulder lightly with hers.

“Hey. Look at me.”

After a few seconds, he did. His eyes were still hazy from cryo, but they focused on her face, on the white hair pulled back from her temples, on the faint smudge of grease she hadn’t noticed on her jaw.

“There you are,” she said, something easing in her chest.

She kept his hand in hers as she started down the narrow path leading away from the hidden door. The undergrowth brushed their boots. Pine needles cracked softly. The forest smelled of resin and damp soil, a sharp contrast to the sterile air below.

“We’re taking the long way,” she said. “Security will be asleep at this hour, but I’d rather not walk past the cameras and wave.”

He followed without comment. His steps were heavy, boots breaking small twigs and grinding stones underfoot. The prosthetic arm hung comfortably at his side now, servos humming faintly.

After a while, Ash glanced back at him, walking backward for a few steps.

“You know this is technically kidnapping,” she said. “Again. You’re being stolen property right now.”

Nothing. Not a huff of amusement. Not even a twitch at the corner of his eye.

She slowed, studying him sidelong. Sunlight filtered through the branches above, sliding in and out over his bare shoulders. It picked out every scar, every uneven line where flesh met metal, turning his body into a map of old decisions.

“You could at least pretend to be annoyed,” she said. “Roll your eyes at me. Scowl. Something.”

He lifted his gaze to her, just briefly. It was an effort; she could see that. Like staring up from deep water. His jaw tightened for half a second.

It was nothing to most people.

To her, it was movement.

“There it is,” she said quietly. “I knew you were still in there.”

She turned back around before he had to hold the eye contact any longer than he could bear. Branches scraped at her sleeves. Her harness creaked with the shift of her shoulders.

“We’re fixing you,” she said after a moment. Less like a joke now. “All of it. Not just the parts they can tighten and weld. The rest too.”

He tilted his head a fraction, like he was parsing the statement for an operational meaning and finding none.

“You’re not just what Pavel built,” she added. “Not to me.”

The path bent, leading deeper into the woods. The sounds of Lintukoto—distant mechanical thuds, the faint whine of generators—faded entirely. Only the forest remained.

“Do you remember the last time we came up here?” Ash asked. “We found that deer skull by the ridge.”

A flicker crossed his expression. Memory. It came not as images but as a sequence of actions: locating the object, assessing it, picking it up, crushing it to test the integrity of his grip. The brittle crack. Bone powder on his fingers.

He remembered her reaction afterward as a sharp tone and a rush of movement. He had assumed it was anger at damage done. He’d waited for the reprimand, for the pain that usually followed mistakes. It never came. That had confused him more than anything.

He blinked now, expecting her to correct his recollection, to rebuild it into whatever version she preferred.

Ash glanced back, caught that slight tension, and huffed a breath that was almost a laugh.

“You know,” she said, “I spent a week thinking you were afraid of it.”

He stared at her, thrown off-balance by the idea.

“I thought you dropped it because it scared you,” she went on. “The way you jerked back, the way you stared. I was—” She shook her head. “I was ready to tell everyone the big terrifying weapon was spooked by a skull.”

She stepped over a fallen log, then looked back at him, eyes narrowing slightly in mock accusation.

“Was that you acting?” she asked. “Trying to get me to hold your hand?”

He stopped walking. A faint furrow creased his brow.

Ash slowed, then laughed under her breath, not the bright, exaggerated kind she used underground when everyone needed noise to keep from thinking too much, but something softer.

“I’m kidding,” she said. “Relax. No one here but trees and very judgmental birds.”

His shoulders loosened by a degree. Not much, but enough that she noticed.

They walked until the trees thinned ahead and the ambient sound changed—less wind in branches, more open air. The light brightened.

The clearing opened in front of them like something cut out of another world.

A shallow hill rolled down to the edge of a lake so still it looked solid from a distance, the surface holding the sky in perfect reflection. Wildflowers grew in scattered patches, nodding gently in the breeze. On the far side, a dark slope of rock rose up, veined with moss and threads of hanging plants. Water spilled down from a gap above, not in a roar but in a steady, clean sheet that broke into spray as it hit the pool below.

Ash stopped at the top of the incline and spread her arms as if she could frame the whole scene between them.

“There,” she said. “Told you it was worth it.”

The words were simple, but her voice had a quiet reverence to it.

Viktor stood beside her, eyes moving across the clearing. The lake. The slope. The waterfall. His brain did what it always did: scanned for movement, cover, sniping positions, places an ambush could be staged.

He found nothing.

Emptiness made him uneasy in a different way.

Ash watched his face, the way his gaze scraped over the world like it was a map instead of a place.

“You can stop searching for targets,” she said, not unkindly. “This spot’s off everybody’s grid. No patrol routes. No drones. Pavel doesn’t waste cameras where he thinks no one goes.”

He didn’t answer, but he stayed beside her instead of drifting to higher ground.

She dropped down onto the grass with a small grunt, boots digging into the soft earth. Leaning back on her hands, she stretched her legs out, shoulders loosening in the warmth. Her crop top clung damply to her skin from the humidity of the pod chamber and the walk, harness webbing dark where sweat had soaked in.

Viktor lowered himself to sit beside her, back straight, hands resting on his knees as if he might be ordered to stand at any moment. Every line of his body was prepared for sudden movement.

“You look like someone’s about to interrogate you,” Ash said. “No one’s going to ask you trick questions here.”

He blinked once.

She drew a breath and let it out slowly, eyes flicking up to the sky.

“Do you want to hear about Trial—” she paused, counting internally and giving up. “Twenty-something. I stopped keeping track. The last one was bad.”

She shifted onto one elbow, facing him more fully.

“They dropped me into a trench full of those blade-flies,” she said. “The metal ones. The ones that slice through fabric and skin if you get too close. And someone thought it would be a good idea to set half of it on fire for environmental stress. So that was fun.”

Viktor’s gaze turned toward her, faintly.

“And on top of that,” she added, “Ottso thought it was the perfect time to test an ocular blocker. Temporary blindness. For ‘adaptation training.’”

That one had stuck with her. The blind panic. The disorientation. The pure, animal urge to crawl away from everything until it stopped.

She threw a hand up briefly, then let it fall.

“I managed,” she said. “Obviously. I’m very annoying and hard to kill. But I’m still sending him a ‘thank you’ card in the form of a mild concussion one of these days.”

Viktor’s head tilted, just a fraction. He was listening. Parsing. Filing away names, details, conditions. It was what he knew how to do.

Ash watched his face. For a second she almost said more—about how she’d had to bite the inside of her cheek so hard to stay quiet that she’d tasted blood for hours afterward—but she swallowed it. He already carried enough.

A small sound cut through her narrative.

Plink.

Something cold tapped against the bare strip of her midriff. Ash’s words trailed off. She looked down at the tiny droplet where it sat, then up.

Another tapped her shoulder. A third dotted the back of her hand.

Cloud had drifted across the sky while she talked, softening the light. The blue had faded to a paler grey. The first thin threads of summer rain began to fall, almost hesitant.

A drop struck Viktor’s shoulder.

His reaction was immediate. He flinched as if struck, eyes snapping to the spot. Another drop hit his chest; he swatted it away, fingers tense, then took a step back, then another. The muscles along his throat tightened. His gaze tracked the falling water like it was shrapnel he couldn’t see.

He moved until he was under the nearest tree, where the branches caught most of it. Water still slipped through in stray threads, spattering his boots.

Ash pushed herself upright slowly. Her shirt and harness were darker now, rain soaking the fabric. Strands of white hair stuck to her cheek. She didn’t wipe them away.

She watched him.

The look on his face wasn’t fear, exactly. It was confusion sharpened by a lifetime of expecting pain. His body read new sensation as threat by default.

“Vik,” she said.

Her voice was quiet, not carrying like before. He looked up at her from the edge of the tree’s shadow.

She stepped forward into the open again, raising her hand, palm up. Rain collected in the curve of it, then overflowed.

“It’s just water,” she said. “Come here.”

He didn’t move.

“I know it feels wrong,” she went on. “Your head thinks unexpected impact means something’s breaking. It isn’t. You’re not in a test. No one’s monitoring your reaction time. There aren’t shock plates under your feet.”

The rain thickened, a steady curtain now. It slicked his hair down against his forehead and neck, pattered off the metal of his arm. He stared out at it like someone watching a wall of fire.

She didn’t push. She just stood there, hand still extended, letting him see that nothing was happening to her. The drops hit her face, her throat, slid under her collar. She blinked them away when they ran into her eyes.

After a long moment, he stepped out from under the branches.

The first few impacts made him flinch again, shoulders knotting. Cold traced down his spine; his skin prickled with it. His breathing hitched, like his body was waiting for the missing follow-up—pain, command, the barked voice of an observer.

Ash closed the distance between them before he could retreat again. She took his hands—one flesh, one metal—and wrapped her fingers around them.

“Stay with me,” she murmured. “Here. Now.”

Her thumbs moved slowly over his knuckles, grounding him in touch that had nothing to do with calibration or restraint.

“You feel that?” she asked. “It’s cold at first. Then your skin adjusts. Give it a little time.”

His breath gradually slowed, settling into something closer to normal. The rain ran down over his chest in thin streams, tracing scars and the edges of metal plates. He watched, the tension in his jaw easing by degrees.

He lifted his eyes to her.

She was close enough now that he could see the individual droplets caught in her eyelashes, the way they trembled before falling away. She was soaked; the fabric of her shirt clung to her, harness straps darkened almost black. But she still looked steady. Patient.

Her hand rose and brushed the wet hair back from his forehead, fingers trailing lightly along his temple. The touch was careful, as if she were afraid of startling him.

“You’re not going to break,” she said. “Not from this. I promise.”

They stood like that as the rain fell around them, turning the clearing into a blurred, shimmering wash of grey and green. The lake rippled where the drops struck, the reflected sky shattering and reforming.

Ash’s hands were still holding his. Her eyes shone, but not just from the water.

Viktor’s body had gone very still. Not the rigid stillness of readiness, but something slower, searching. He concentrated on the unfamiliar combination of sensations: the weight of the rain, the warmth of her hands, the absence of shouting, of alarms, of pain.

A question rose from some place in him he rarely listened to.

“…Why?” he asked.

The word caught on the way out, rough with disuse. It was barely louder than the rain.

Ash blinked. Her eyebrows drew together slightly.

“Why what?” she asked, voice soft, thumb brushing the edge of his jaw where skin met the metal line of his mask.

He hesitated, eyes dropping, then forcing themselves back up to her face. He looked at her like he’d been taught his whole life not to.

“Why do you keep coming back for me?” he said. “When you don’t have to.”

There it was. The core of it. No training module had ever given him a script for this.

Ash stared at him for a moment. Rain struck her cheekbones, slid down. She let them fall.

Then, slowly, she smiled.

Not the loud, performative grin she wore when she was covering for someone else’s terror or her own. This one was smaller, quieter. It softened the lines of her face in a way that almost hurt.

“Because you’re mine,” she said.

She held his gaze so he could see she meant it.

“I don’t have a better answer than that,” she added, a little breath leaving her on the words. “I don’t need one.”

His jaw clenched again, but this time it wasn’t from restraint. Something in his chest twisted against an old, rigid frame.

“I don’t know how to be anything,” he said, the admission dragged out like something that had been buried under armor. “I wasn’t made for that. I’m… not real outside of orders.”

Ash’s expression changed. The smile faded at the edges, leaving something rawer. She lifted both hands to his face, fingers sliding up to tuck more of his hair back, then bracing lightly along his cheeks. The metal of the mask was cool under her palms; the skin above it was colder still from the rain.

“You don’t have to be anything,” she said. “Not with me.”

Her thumbs rested just under his eyes.

“You don’t have to earn this. Or prove you deserve to stand here. You don’t have to fight anything or carry anything right now. You can just be a person breathing in the rain with someone who refuses to leave you alone.”

He swallowed. His throat worked around the unfamiliar weight of the idea.

“I’m not supposed to feel like this,” he murmured. It sounded half like a protest, half like a confession to himself. “It doesn’t fit.”

Ash leaned in, closer, until her forehead almost brushed his.

“I feel you,” she said. “I see you. Whatever they wrote in your file, that’s not all you are. You’re real to me, Vik. That’s enough.”

His eyes met hers again. No weapon’s blankness now. Just a damaged boy trying to make sense of a language he’d never been taught.

“…You feel it too?” he asked.

The rain filled the pause. The waterfall, the lake, the wind—all of it seemed to recede for a heartbeat.

Ash’s breath hitched. She nodded, once.

“Yeah,” she said. “I do.”

Her hands slid down, fingers finding the edges of the half-mask he wore. The black metal had always looked like a muzzle to her, a piece of armor welded not to protect him but to claim him.

She hesitated only long enough to be sure he wasn’t pulling away.

He didn’t.

Small clasps released with quiet clicks under her touch. A seal broke with a soft hiss as the mask loosened. She lifted it off carefully, as if it were fragile instead of hardened composite, then let it hang in one hand for a second before lowering it to the wet grass at their feet.

His face, without it, looked younger. Sharper. A scar tugged one corner of his mouth. The tension around his eyes was still there, but now it had somewhere to go.

Ash cupped his cheeks again, thumbs brushing away rain that didn’t need wiping.

For a moment, she just looked at him, giving him time to adjust to being seen like this.

Then she rose on her toes and kissed him.

It wasn’t a dramatic gesture. There was no sudden crash of thunder, no cinematic sweep. Just a careful press of lips, tentative at first, then steadier as he didn’t pull back. His mouth was cool from the rain, firm and uncertain. She felt the way his breath stuttered, the tiny catch as his hands flexed uselessly at his sides before finally, slowly, closing around her wrists.

She didn’t hurry him. She let him move at his own pace, let him learn the shape of this without checklists or evaluations. It was contact without purpose beyond itself.

Not a test.

Not conditioning.

Just touch.

Just him.

Just hers.

Just Viktor.
