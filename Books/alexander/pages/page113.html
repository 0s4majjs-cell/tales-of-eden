<p>“I am not here to reassure you,” she replied. Then she stuck out a hand. “Mira Hartmann. I run the Wache and Außenposten. Guards and outposts.”</p>
<p>Her grip was firm, warm despite the cold.</p>
<p>“Alexander Colt,” I said again, though she already knew. “But you know that.”</p>
<p>“Ja,” she said. “But here we do names properly. Sonst gibt es Chaos.” Otherwise there is chaos.</p>
<p>Elias stepped in behind her.</p>
<p>“You eat?” he asked. “Last night?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Stew. Bread. Didn’t leave a trace.”</p>
<p>“Gut,” he said. “You will need it.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked, even though I already knew the answer.</p>
<p>Mira answered for him.</p>
<p>“Because you start paying rent today,” she said. “You hunt, like you said.”</p>
<p>“Already?” I asked. “Don’t I get a tour first? Maybe a welcome basket?”</p>
<p>Elias snorted. Mira’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>“This <em>is</em> the welcome,” she said. “You want a bed that is not quarantäne and a roof that does not leak onto your face, you work. Hunting is… simple. Clear. Low politics. Good for first day.”</p>
<p>Simple. Sure.</p>
