<p>I raised my hands slowly. The bag strap dug into my shoulder. My fingers spread automatically, palms open.</p>
<p>Metal clicked above me. Rifles shifting, safeties, bolts. I couldn’t see them properly from this angle, but I <em>felt</em> them—thin, invisible lines running from the wall straight through my chest.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!” another voice called from closer in, ground level this time. “Nicht bewegen! Stay where you are!”</p>
<p>“I’m not moving!” I called back. My voice sounded smaller than I wanted in the cold air.</p>
<p>“Louder!” the first voice barked.</p>
<p>“I’m not moving!” I repeated, forcing my lungs to work. “Hands are up!”</p>
<p>There was a low burst of conversation above the gate, too fast and too soft for me to catch anything but rhythm.</p>
<p>Then the main doors—two big slabs of welded metal from three different lifetimes—shifted, scraped, and groaned open just enough for two people to step through.</p>
<p>They walked out with the controlled kind of confidence that said they’d survived too many bad days already.</p>
