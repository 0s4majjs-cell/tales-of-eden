<p>Some part of me was still hunting. Looking for familiar faces in the chaos. Maybe if I found someone alive, anything would make more sense.</p>
<p>The main square was where my feet took me.</p>
<p>It was or had been Rustfield’s heart. The place with the oil drums and the trading tables and that dumb string of colored plastic Enzo had once insisted on hanging up because “it makes this shithole look <em>less</em> like a grave, Colt.”</p>
<p>Now it looked like the center of an explosion someone had paused halfway through.</p>
<p>The ground was split. Cracks ran through the old concrete, some wide enough to swallow my foot. A couple of the oil drums lay on their sides, fire licking out of them. The stumps of posts where tarps had been strung were snapped.</p>
<p>And in the middle of it all lay the thing that had done this.</p>
<p>For a second, my brain refused to parse it. It was just a pile of twisted something. Metal? Concrete?</p>
