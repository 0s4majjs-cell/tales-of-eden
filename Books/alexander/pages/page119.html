<p>There, in the hollow beyond, three roe deer picked their way through the snow. Small, delicate things, more leg than anything else. Their coats were winter-dull, blending with the dead grass. Steam puffed from their nostrils in thin clouds as they nosed for something edible.</p>
<p>“Zwei Ricken, ein Bock,” Enzo breathed. Two does, one buck. “We take one. No more.”</p>
<p>He studied the wind again, then pointed to a broken chunk of concrete a few meters ahead.</p>
<p>“You go there,” he said. “Lie down. Wait. I stay here. If you miss, I try. But besser, you do not miss, hm?”</p>
<p>“Got it,” I whispered.</p>
<p>I eased forward, keeping low, rifle hugged close. The concrete chunk gave me just enough height to see over the rise while staying mostly hidden. I slid into position, laid the rifle along the edge, and let my cheek find the familiar place on the stock.</p>
<p>Breath in. The cold burned my lungs. Breath out. The world narrowed down.</p>
