<p>I rolled, trying to get my legs under me.</p>
<p>Too slow.</p>
<p>The moose hit.</p>
<p>Not full-on. If it had, that would have been it. Just a glancing blow from its shoulder and chest as it barreled past, its front leg catching mine.</p>
<p>Pain detonated in my lower right leg—sharp, blinding, hot. Something in there gave with a wet, sick crack.</p>
<p>I screamed without meaning to. The sound came out thin and high in the cold air.</p>
<p>The world narrowed to that one spot.</p>
<p>I felt more than saw the moose stumble as another shot hit. It crashed into a tree, snapped smaller branches like kindling, then went down in a heap that shook the ground.</p>
<p>Silence crashed in over the ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>My breath came in ragged gasps. Every tiny shift sent another bolt of pain up my leg. My hands clawed at the snow, as if I could pull myself away from my own bones.</p>
<p>“Colt!”</p>
<p>Enzo slid into view, boots digging furrows in the snow, rifle already slung.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” he said. “Bleib liegen. Stay down.”</p>
