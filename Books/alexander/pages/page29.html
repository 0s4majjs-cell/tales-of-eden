<p>“…might as well just end it,” I muttered.</p>
<p>It came out more defeated than dramatic. The idea of being trapped in my own body, useless in a world built out of teeth, was worse than dying on that street.</p>
<p>Before the thought could really settle, I heard it: the slow, measured creak of footsteps on old wood. They drew closer, each one careful but heavy, heading straight for the door. My muscles tensed on reflex. Whoever this was had saved me. They’d also, technically, kidnapped me.</p>

Middle-aged, maybe older, with a grey beanie pulled low over dark, messy hair and a beard that fell halfway down his chest. His clothes were rough and practical—thick fabric, faded from use, stained with dirt and smoke and work.</p>
<p>“You seem to be alright now,” he said.</p>
<p>That’s when I saw the pistol in his hand. It was pointed directly at me.</p>
<p>My mouth went dry.</p>
