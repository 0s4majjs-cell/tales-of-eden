<p>The light dimmed by degrees. Winter afternoons didn’t linger. The sky slid from bright grey to dirty steel. My breath hung in front of me longer. The tips of my fingers prickled inside my gloves.</p>
<p>Then I found what I’d been looking for.</p>
<p>Hoof tracks. Fresh.</p>
<p>Sharp-edged marks cutting across a slope, snow still soft around them. Small, paired—not a moose, thank God. Roe deer, probably.</p>
<p>My chest loosened a fraction.</p>
<p>“About time,” I muttered.</p>
<p>I followed, moving slower now. The prints looped and meandered, stopping here and there where the animal had pawed at the snow to reach something edible.</p>
<p>The forest felt… less dead in that direction. Subtle things: the way the wind moved differently through the branches, the faint sound of something shifting weight ahead.</p>
<p>I heard the deer before I saw it. Soft scrapes, the careful crunch of hooves.</p>
<p>I crawled the last few meters up a small rise and eased myself behind a tangle of roots and dead brush. From there I could see into a shallow hollow.</p>
