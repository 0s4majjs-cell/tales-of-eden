<p>The mechanic, Emil, sitting on an overturned crate with some gutted piece of tech in his lap, tongue between his teeth as he soldered two dead worlds together into something that might flicker for one more month.</p>
<p>The old man, Helmut, in his chair at the same patch of fence every afternoon, blanket over his missing legs, mug in hand, watching the gate like it owed him a favor.</p>
<p>I ended up next to Helmut more than once, mostly because there was a crate nearby that made a decent seat.</p>
<p>“Sit,” he told me the first time, jabbing the crate with his mug. “You’re making the lane look uneven.”</p>
<p>I sat.</p>
<p>He nodded at my cast.</p>
<p>“Moose?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Didn’t like my face.”</p>
<p>“Road accident,” he said, tapping the blanket over where his knees would have been. “Old truck. New ice. Dumb mix.”</p>
<p>“Before all this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Before the walls, during <em>that</em> catastrophe.” he said. “Bad period for my balance.”</p>
<p>He took a drink, squinting toward the gate.</p>
<p>Catastrophe? Whatever.</p>
