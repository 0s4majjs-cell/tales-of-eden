<p>My head was starting to pound by the time I found the door.</p>
<p>Half-hidden behind a dead turret housing, small enough to miss if you weren’t looking for it. Yellow paint flaked off the metal around it, leaving only fragments of the stencilled words.</p>
<p><strong>…INTENANCE ONLY</strong></p>
<p>Good enough.</p>
<p>The handle was stiff, but the lock might as well have been decorative. Two hard yanks and a curse later, it gave.</p>
<p>The door opened onto a narrow cylinder of space and a spiral of metal stairs clinging to its inside. No lights. Just thin grey filtering down from above and the suggestion of darkness below.</p>
<p>My stomach dipped.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I muttered. “Why not.”</p>
<p>I stepped onto the first stair. It creaked alarmingly and held. I kept one hand tight around the railing and started down.</p>
<p>Around and around, boots ringing on metal, breath fogging the air in front of me. The Safe Zone vanished behind the curve of the wall. The city beyond the walls slid into view in slices.</p>
