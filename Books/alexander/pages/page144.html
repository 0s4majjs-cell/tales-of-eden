<p>At night, in my little room, I’d sit on the bed with the notebook open and write until my hand cramped. Not just what happened, but how it felt. The way Rustfield smelled at dusk. The way Mira’s voice carried without having to shout. The way fear and routine sat next to each other in everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>On the eighth day, the routine broke my leg.</p>
<p>We were further out than usual.</p>
<p>Not by much. Just one more kilometer, one more line of trees, one more old road funneling us into what Enzo called “good ground” and I called “probably a bad idea.”</p>
<p>Snow had built up in deceptive ways. It looked flat until you stepped on it and dropped into a hidden ditch. I’d already done that twice, swearing and yanking my foot out of holes full of broken brick.</p>
<p>The tracks we followed were fresh. Bigger than roe. Heavier.</p>
<p>“Moose?” I asked, because that’s what it looked like.</p>
<p>Enzo nodded once, serious. The usual jokes sat this one out.</p>
<p>“Alces,” he said. “Bull, I think. Big. We get this home, Gretel sings for us.”</p>
