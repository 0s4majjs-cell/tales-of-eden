<p>One afternoon deep into winter, I moved through the skeletal remains of what had once been a small town, snow crunching under my boots. A rifle hung from my shoulder. My breath came out in steady white puffs. To my left, in the treeline, a guttural sound echoed—somewhere between a grunt and a roar. A moose.</p>
<p>I slipped behind a half-crumbling wall, raised the rifle, and waited. Two slow breaths. Sight, line, squeeze. The crack of the shot rolled across the ruins. Then silence.</p>
<p>Viggo padded ahead, nose to the ground, leading me to where the animal had fallen. He wagged his tail once, sharply, as if to say <em>good enough.</em></p>
<p>Dragging the moose back to the barn was its own special hell. Karl had helped me rig a sled out of old sheet metal and rope, but “help” ended there. The animal’s weight turned each meter into a minor war. My shoulders screamed. My legs burned. My fingers ached inside my gloves.</p>
