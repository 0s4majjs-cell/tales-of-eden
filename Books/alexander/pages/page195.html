<p>I sucked in air too fast. It tasted like ash and copper. I coughed, eyes burning, lungs protesting.</p>
<p>Move.</p>
<p>I didn’t know if that was my own voice or Karl’s echoing through memory. Didn’t matter. I forced my feet to go around Jason. Not through him. Around.</p>
<p>“Else!” I yelled, because if Jason was here, she had to be somewhere. “Else! Enzo!”</p>
<p>A sound answered, thin and ugly.</p>
<p>Not a word. A wet, rattling cough.</p>
<p>I followed it down a side lane, almost slipping where something red had frozen and thawed and frozen again.</p>
<p>She was propped against a low brick wall, not far from where she usually stood leaning on it, talking shit about everyone and everything.</p>
<p>It took me a second to recognize her.</p>
<p>Else’s face was grey under the soot, all the color sucked out. Her hair was plastered to her forehead, streaked dark with sweat and smoke. Her eyes didn’t look like they usually did—too big, too bright, like the pupils were trying to swallow the rest.</p>
<p>Her right leg was just… gone.</p>
