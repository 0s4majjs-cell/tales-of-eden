<p>The edge of the walls came into view in jagged pieces through the murk.</p>
<p>Then I saw the hole.</p>
<p>A whole section of the west wall wasn’t a wall anymore.</p>
<p>Logs had been snapped, thrown inward and outward. Some lay in splintered chunks. Others stuck out at angles, half-buried in the torn-up ground. The metal sheets people had bolted on as extra reinforcement were peeled back and twisted, edges curled.</p>
<p>Something big had gone through. Not climbed. Not slipped. <em>Gone through.</em></p>
<p>The earth in front of the breach was chewed up—deep gouges, churned mud, dirty snow trampled into a stained slurry. Like the ground had tried to resist and failed.</p>
<p>Heat rolled out of the opening, hit my face, made my eyes water even before the smoke did.</p>
<p>I slowed. My body didn’t want to go the last few meters. Some stupid, animal part of me understood that once I stepped through, there was no pretending it was just a bad dream I’d wake up from.</p>
<p>I stepped through.</p>
<p>It felt like walking into the inside of someone’s lungs.</p>
