<p><em>How did they even manage to become such a threat,</em> I kept catching myself thinking, <em>when there’s barely any of them here?</em></p>
<p>Maybe I was just walking through the spaces between disasters.</p>
<p>Another week passed. Or I think it did. Days blurred together when all you did was walk and endure.</p>
<p>I crested a low hill one afternoon and stopped dead.</p>
<p>Smoke.</p>
<p>Not a thin, wandering line from some lone traveler’s fire. A thicker column, rising steady. Dark at the base, grey at the top. Controlled.</p>
<p>My stomach tightened before my brain finished the thought.</p>
<p>I dropped into a crouch on instinct and stayed there, breathing shallow, watching. The wind cut across the hill and brought scents with it: burned wood, cooked food, a faint, oily trace of fuel. Human smells. More than one person. More than a couple.</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds. A minute. Nothing moved in the valley itself. Just that steady climb of smoke.</p>
