<p>The door opened without knocking this time. I jerked upright, heart spiking, before my brain caught up.</p>
<p>The woman from the gate stood in the doorway. The red armband sat on her upper arm now too. Elias was behind her, filling the frame.</p>
<p>“Guten Morgen,” she said. Then, in English: “Good morning.”</p>
<p>“Morning,” I replied, scrubbing a hand over my face. “Guess I didn’t die in the night.”</p>
<p>“That is a good start,” she said dryly. “Stand up, please.”</p>
<p>I swung my legs over the side of the cot and got to my feet. They held. That felt like another good sign.</p>
<p>She stepped inside, eyes scanning me the way they had out at the gate. Not suspicious exactly. Just… measuring.</p>
<p>“No fever?” she asked. “No strange Schmerzen? Pain? Head, chest, joints?”</p>
<p>“Just the usual ‘I’ve been sleeping on something that hates me’ pain,” I said. “Nothing new.”</p>
<p>She glanced at Elias. He gave the smallest nod.</p>
<p>“Gut,” she said. “Then we assume you are not a walking disaster. Yet.”</p>
<p>“That’s… reassuring,” I said.</p>
