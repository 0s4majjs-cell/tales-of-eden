<p>Something had gotten there first. The snow around it was scuffed with prints I didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>Enzo crouched, brows drawing together.</p>
<p>“Wolf?” I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Too light,” he said. “Fox, vielleicht. Maybe. Or dog.”</p>
<p>“Dog?” I echoed. “Wild?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes people set them free when they cannot feed them,” he said. “Sometimes they run.”</p>
<p>“Better than eating them,” I muttered.</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>We moved on.</p>
<p>Late morning bled into early afternoon. The sky never really changed color, just shifted from one shade of dirty grey to another.</p>
<p>We spotted deer sign around a line of old trees—droppings, tracks, a branch nibbled clean. Enzo took the lead without speaking. I followed, breath slow, rifle loose in my hands.</p>
<p>It wasn’t exciting. It wasn’t cinematic. It was just walking and stopping and listening until your muscles screamed and your brain swore there was nothing out there worth finding.</p>
<p>We found them anyway.</p>
