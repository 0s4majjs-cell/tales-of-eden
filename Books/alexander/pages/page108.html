<p><em>Think tomorrow,</em> I told myself. <em>For once in your life, just… sleep first.</em></p>
<p>Somewhere between one breath and the next, the tension unwound just enough for me to drop.</p>
<p>The knock woke me. Three short raps on metal, close enough that it felt like someone tapping directly on my skull.</p>
<p>I blinked up at the ceiling, disoriented for a second. Rustfield. Quarantine room. Not snow. Not Karl’s barn. The air smelled like old disinfectant and tin.</p>
<p>“Essen.” Food.</p>
<p>The voice was muffled through the door. Male. Young, maybe. I pushed myself upright, muscles creaking.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I croaked. “I’m awake.”</p>
<p>A little hatch low in the door scraped open. A tray slid through: a dented metal bowl full of something steaming, a chunk of bread, another cup of water.</p>
<p>“Step back,” the voice said. “Zwei Schritte. Two steps.”</p>
<p>I did, holding my hands where he could see them. The tray came all the way in, then the hatch slammed shut again.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then: “Gern.” You’re welcome.</p>
