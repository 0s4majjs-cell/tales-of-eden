<p>I learned silence. I learned how to breathe so that the rise and fall of my chest didn’t shake the barrel of a gun. I learned how to lie still in the snow until numbness set in and wait for a target to make the first mistake.</p>
<p>And I learned, one small moment at a time, that trust really was something tested, not given.</p>
<p>Months bled into each other. The bruises changed, the scars accumulated, but somehow I kept waking up. Slowly, almost reluctantly, my body adapted. I stopped gasping halfway up the hill. My hands steadied. My shots landed closer to where I wanted them to.</p>
<p>Karl never once taught me how to fight another human. He never walked me through strategies for taking on mutants, either.</p>
<p>“You’re not a soldier,” he would say whenever I pushed. “You’re a survivor. You only fight if running’s worse.”</p>
<p>When it came to open combat, I was still useless. But I could hunt. I could track. I could keep my hands moving even when my fingers felt like ice. I could breathe through fear without freezing.</p>
