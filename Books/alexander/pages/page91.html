<p>Slowly, I slipped my bag off one shoulder and pulled my binoculars out with numb fingers. The metal bit at my skin. I pressed the lenses to my eyes and inched forward until the valley opened up beneath me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a town. Not really.</p>
<p>Someone had carved a perimeter into the ruins. A ring of rough wooden walls—logs where they’d had trees, scavenged beams everywhere else—all sharpened to points at the top. Watch platforms broke the line at intervals. On each platform: a figure, a rifle, a silhouette used to standing still. Inside, containers and makeshift shacks clustered tight into the shells of old buildings. Tarps stretched between them like low, tired clouds.</p>
<p>Fires burned behind the walls. Two, maybe three. Light flickered under the tarps, orange and dirty.</p>
<p>Minor safe zone. Fortified camp. Gang stronghold. The label didn’t matter. It was a place built specifically to keep people like me <em>out.</em></p>
