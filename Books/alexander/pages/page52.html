<p>“Where are we going?” I asked, adjusting the strap.</p>
<p>“Town,” Karl said.</p>
<p>I stared past him, toward the broken shapes on the horizon. “That’s… specific.”</p>
<p>He gave me a look. “You wanted to see the world, didn’t you? Congratulations. Today you get the scenic tour of what’s left of a shopping district.”</p>
<p>“Wow,” I said. “Dreams really do come true.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Try not to die in them.”</p>
<p>We started walking. Snow crunched under our boots. After a minute of silence, I cleared my throat.</p>
<p>“So,” I said, “is this like… a ‘you’ve survived a year, let’s go on a field trip’ thing, or a ‘we’re running out of canned beans’ thing?”</p>
<p>Karl shifted the weight of his pack. “Think of it as… curriculum expansion.”</p>
<p>“That sounds fake.”</p>
<p>“Everything out here sounds fake,” he said. “Doesn’t stop it from killing you.”</p>
<p>“Comforting pep talk,” I muttered.</p>
<p>He smirked, just a little. “You want comfort, you should’ve stayed behind the wall.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Because that was so comfortable.”</p>
