<p>Fire licked along tarps and wooden frames, crawling sideways in places, climbing up in others. Containers were on their sides, doors ripped open or caved in. Some were just black shells now. Sparks drifted everywhere, landing on my coat, fizzling out.</p>
<p>Smoke hugged the ground in pockets, thick and low. It hid things until I was almost on top of them.</p>
<p>The first body I nearly stepped on.</p>
<p>Black boots. Jeans burned off at the knees. What was left from there up was… more charcoal than person. Fused to a sheet of metal that had once been part of a wall.</p>
<p>The smell coming off it hit hard enough to make my stomach flip. Fat, meat, hair, plastic. Sweet and sick and impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>My foot skidded in something wet and slick. I didn’t look down. Couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Jonas!” I shouted, voice cracking. “Mira!”</p>
<p>The fire ate most of the sound. Somewhere off to my left, something structural collapsed with a bang and a shower of sparks.</p>
