<p>I swung my legs over the side of the bed and sat up. The floor was cold, but not the kind of cold that went straight to the bone. I spat dry taste out of my mouth, scrubbed both hands over my face, and listened.</p>
<p>Voices drifted through the wall. Low, blurry, overlapping. Someone laughed once, fast. A baby cried somewhere in the building, got shushed. The smell of woodsmoke and cooked something seeped under the door.</p>
<p>I pulled on my boots and jacket and stepped out into the hallway.</p>
<p>It was narrow and a little too low, the kind of place built for another purpose and reused because nobody had anything better. Doors on both sides, some open, some closed. A woman in a heavy sweater shuffled past me with a bucket, nodded once without slowing. Grey in her hair, lines at the corners of her eyes, expression set to permanent tired.</p>
<p>“’Morgen,” she muttered.</p>
<p>“Morning,” I answered automatically.</p>
