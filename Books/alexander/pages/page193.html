<p>Rustfield had always been noisy. Even when people were tired. Someone arguing about ration shares. Kids crying. Jonas bitching about standing shifts. Enzo singing badly to himself under his breath.</p>
<p>Now it was mostly fire and the pops of things giving up.</p>
<p>I moved without really deciding where I was going. Just following lanes I knew by habit, brain insisting on checking places where people usually were.</p>
<p>The butcher’s corner was just… gone. The hooks that had held up carcasses were bent and twisted. The roof had caved in. There was a hand sticking out from under a chunk of corrugated metal, fingers stiff, palm up. I didn’t check whose.</p>
<p>“Enzo!” I shouted. My voice went higher than I liked. “Enzo!”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>I turned into the main lane and stopped so abruptly my legs almost went out from under me.</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
<p>Face-up in the middle of the path.</p>
