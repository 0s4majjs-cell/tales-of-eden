<p>I found Enzo near the butcher’s corner, arguing about cuts with Gretel like they were haggling over a car instead of a carcass.</p>
<p>I almost turned away.</p>
<p>Instead, I forced my feet to carry me closer.</p>
<p>“Enzo,” I said.</p>
<p>He glanced over, took in the uncovered leg, the careful step.</p>
<p>“You’re walking,” he said.</p>
<p>“Trying to,” I said. “Else says I can graduate to ‘idiot on two feet’ as long as I don’t sprint.”</p>
<p>“High bar,” he said.</p>
<p>We stood there for a second, the noise of the camp moving around us.</p>
<p>“I… said some shit,” I managed finally. “At the table. About settling. And clerks. And… you know what I said.”</p>
<p>“I do,” he said.</p>
<p>“I was angry about my own crap,” I said. “Didn’t mean to throw it at you. Or at what you do here. You’re the reason I’m not dead in a ditch right now. So—” I swallowed. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He studied me for a long moment.</p>
<p>“‘Crippled clerk,’” he quoted.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “That one’s been echoing in my skull too.”</p>
<p>He let out a slow breath.</p>
