<p>I ended up sprawled on my back, staring up at a sky that look exactly as uncaring from the outside as it had from the inside.</p>
<p>The truck’s tail lights were already moving away, red glows shrinking between ruined buildings. They didn’t slow. They didn’t stop.</p>
<p>I lay there, mouth opening and closing, trying to remember how to breathe.</p>
<p>Air finally forced its way back in, burning all the way down. I coughed, which hurt more.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I wheezed, to no one. “Okay. That… could have gone better.”</p>
<p>Every bit of me hurt. My right arm refused to cooperate when I tried to push myself up; a hot line of pain ran from my shoulder down into my ribs. My palms burned where skin had been scraped away. My hip throbbed. My face stung.</p>
<p>But nothing felt… loose. Not in the way it shouldn’t. My teeth were all still in my head. I could move both legs.</p>
<p>Small victories.</p>
<p>I rolled onto my left side and forced myself upright inch by inch.</p>
