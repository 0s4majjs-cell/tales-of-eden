<p>One of the does lifted her head, ears flicking. I stayed still. The buck turned slightly, quartering away, giving me a clean line just behind the shoulder.</p>
<p>Breath in.</p>
<p><em>Don’t snatch, don’t hurry.</em> Karl’s voice again. <em>You’re not fighting the trigger. You’re asking nicely.</em></p>

<p>The crack of the shot snapped through the quiet. Birds exploded out of the nearby trees in a panic of wings. The buck jerked, stumbled, and crashed into the snow. The does bolted, white rumps flashing, vanished between the trunks.</p>
<p>Silence dropped back in, heavier.</p>
<p>My heart hammered against my ribs. I kept the rifle up for another second, watching. The buck didn’t get up.</p>
