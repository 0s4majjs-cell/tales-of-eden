<p>Towers snapped in half. Bridges cut short. Streets choked with debris and ice. Everything dead and white and wide.</p>
<p>The sky felt wrong. Too big. Like someone had pulled the ceiling off my life and forgotten to put anything else there.</p>
<p>For a second I just stood there, breathing clouds into the cold, bag strap biting into my palm.</p>
<p>Then the practical part of my brain spoke up.</p>
<p><em>You’re on top of a seventy-meter wall with no idea how to get down, genius.</em></p>
<p>The walkway stretched left and right, a narrow strip of metal lined with railings and the carcasses of old auto-turrets. A few 74’s moved in the distance, small dark shapes against the steel.</p>
<p>I kept low and headed away from the elevator, boots clanging softly, eyes scanning for anything that looked like stairs or a ladder or even a service hatch.</p>
<p>Guards passed twice, going the other way. Both times I dropped behind whatever cover I could find and held my breath while their footsteps scraped past.</p>
