<p>Getting vertical was its own little war.</p>
<p>My arms shook. My ribs complained. The leg in the cast lit up the second I tried to move it.</p>
<p>“Breathe,” Else snapped. “You don’t faint on me. I don’t have space on the floor for you.”</p>
<p>“You’re very comforting, you know that?” I grunted.</p>
<p>She planted the crutches in front of me.</p>
<p>“Stand,” she said. “One leg. Use your arms. The cast does not touch the ground. If it does, I will personally break the other one to remind you how it felt.”</p>
<p>I believed her.</p>
<p>I pushed myself up. My shoulders took most of it. My good leg wobbled. The room swayed for a second, then settled.</p>
<p>“Gut,” she said. “Now: door, back, twice. Then you rest.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t walking. It was inching the world past me in little jerks of wood and muscle.</p>
<p>Left crutch, right crutch, good foot. Lift. Repeat.</p>
<p>By the time I’d reached the door and turned around, sweat ran cold down my back. My hands ached. My armpits hurt in muscles I didn’t know existed.</p>
