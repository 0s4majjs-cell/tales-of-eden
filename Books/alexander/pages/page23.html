<p>Before my fingers stopped being able to feel the straps of my bag. After my right arm went from sharp hurt to a deep, sick ache. Before the light started to drain out of the sky. After I caught myself stumbling in a way I didn’t like.</p>
<p>My breath turned to a constant fog in front of me. My jaw ached from clenching. The cold wasn’t just on my skin anymore; it had settled inside my bones.</p>
<p>“Shelter,” I muttered at one point, mostly to keep my mouth moving. “Just one room. Four walls. Hell, I’ll take three.”</p>
<p>The city didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Every doorway I passed had its door ripped off, or its floors collapsed, or signs that someone else had been there recently and might come back. I was tired enough that even my paranoia felt slow, but not tired enough to bed down somewhere that said SAFE in big invisible letters even I could read.</p>
<p>By the time the sky went from grey to the deep pre-night blue, my thoughts were mostly just <em>cold</em> and <em>forward.</em></p>
<p>My knees buckled without asking my opinion.</p>
