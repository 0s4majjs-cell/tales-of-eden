<p>“So what,” I said through my fingers, “you want me to leave tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“I want you to leave when you’re ready,” Karl said. “But I also know you’re never gonna <em>feel</em> ready. So at some point, you just gotta pick a day and be wrong about it.”</p>
<p>I dropped my hands. The table between us suddenly felt… smaller. Closer.</p>
<p>“When did <em>you</em> pick your day?” I asked.</p>
<p>He considered that.</p>
<p>“When my wife and kid died,” he said, and there was no drama in it. Just fact. “World took the house. I decided it didn’t get to decide what I did next. So I walked until this place felt like enough. Now it is. For me. Doesn’t have to be for you.”</p>
<p>We let that hang there. There wasn’t anything I could put on top of it that wouldn’t sound pathetic by comparison.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said finally. “Okay. Then… I guess I should pick a day.”</p>
<p>Karl nodded slowly. “Yeah. You should.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow,” I heard myself say, before I could talk myself out of it. “If I wait longer, I’ll just… find excuses.”</p>
