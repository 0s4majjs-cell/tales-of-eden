<p>I stopped at one of the windows, peering in. The inside was a chaotic mess of broken glass and toppled furniture, sunlight slanting through the gaps.</p>
<p>“Ever eat at a place like that?” I asked.</p>
<p>Karl stepped up beside me, eyes scanning the street, not the building. “Once,” he said. “Before the walls.”</p>
<p>“What was it like?”</p>
<p>“Loud,” he said. “Too many people, not enough space.” He paused. “Good coffee, though.”</p>
<p>“Coffee,” I repeated, like it was a spell. “I’ve read about that. Bitter, right?”</p>
<p>“If you make it wrong,” he said.</p>
<p>“You ever think about it?” I asked. “Going back inside just for… stuff like that?”</p>
<p>He shook his head once. “No.”</p>
<p>“Not even for coffee?”</p>
<p>“Coffee doesn’t taste right if you buy it with someone else’s life,” he said.</p>
<p>I looked at him. “That’s… specific.”</p>

<p>Karl’s voice dropped. “Stop.”</p>
