<p>“Nice to meet you, Karl,” I said. “How long was I out?”</p>
<p>Karl glanced at the watch on his wrist. “’Bout eight hours,” he said.</p>
<p>Eight hours. I’d gone from almost dying in the snow to lying in a warm bed in less than half a day. My life had turned into one of the stories I used to read—only my arm hurt too much for it to feel fictional.</p>
<p>“You get some rest, boy,” Karl said, adjusting the strap of his holster. “Once you’re steady on your feet, I’ll teach you how to stay alive out here. Got it?”</p>
<p>The offer was so sudden I almost missed it.</p>
<p>“Got it,” I replied.</p>
<p>He gave a short nod, whistled once. Viggo hopped off the bed and trotted to his side. Karl stepped out, holding the door open for the dog, then pulled it closed behind them.</p>
<p>I stared at the door for a long second, then sank back into the pillow. Saved by a stranger. Fed, patched up, offered survival lessons. Luck, I thought, might not hate me completely after all.</p>
