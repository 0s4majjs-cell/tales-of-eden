<p>“Thank you,” I said. It didn’t feel like enough, but it was all I had.</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me,” she said. “Thank the Reh. And that you did not miss.”</p>
<p>She hesitated, then added, “You get your pistol back tonight. Beim Abendessen.” At dinner.</p>
<p>“Good to know,” I said. “I was starting to miss the weight.”</p>
<p>Mira nodded once, turned to go, then paused in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Alexander,” she said. “One more thing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“You are inside walls again,” she said. “But this is not Berlin. Here, people see you. If you want to stay, you let them. Verstanden?”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Understood.”</p>
