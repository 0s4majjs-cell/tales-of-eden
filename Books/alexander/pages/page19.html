<p>If I stayed on, I had no idea where I’d end up. Some outpost. Some depot. Somewhere I’d be found and either shot, shoved back inside, or put to work under rules I didn’t know.</p>
<p>If I got off, I had… whatever this was. Ruins. Cold. Hunger.</p>
<p>Both options looked bad. Only one of them was mine.</p>
<p>I tightened the straps on my bag and dragged myself toward the tailgate.</p>
<p>The truck hit a pothole the size of a grave.</p>
<p>I didn’t so much jump as get thrown.</p>
<p>One moment I was crouched at the edge, waiting for the right rhythm. The next the floor kicked up under me and I was airborne, fingers clawing at nothing.</p>
<p>The road came up and hit me hard.</p>
<p>Pain exploded along my right side. My shoulder lit up white-hot. The impact knocked the breath out of me so thoroughly that for a second I honestly wondered if my lungs had just… stopped existing.</p>
<p>I bounced, rolled, scraped over ice and rough asphalt. The world became a jumble of grey and white and sharp edges. Something tore under me—clothing, skin, both.</p>
<p>Then it was over.</p>
