<p>Boots skidding on dust and oil, I ran alongside it and grabbed the tailgate. The metal was icy enough to burn. My feet left the ground.</p>
<p>For a breathless second I dangled there, nothing under me but moving concrete. The tunnel yawned ahead; the bay was already sliding past behind.</p>
<p>My shoulders screamed. The strap of my bag cut across my chest.</p>
<p>I hauled myself up in ugly, stuttering jerks. One knee over the edge, then the other, then a full-body heave that dumped me into the back of the truck.</p>
<p>I landed on my side hard enough to knock the air out of me.</p>
<p>No one shouted. No one banged on the side to tell the driver to stop.</p>
<p>I crawled to the flapping edge of the tarp, grabbed it, and dragged it down. It didn’t close perfectly, but it covered enough.</p>
<p>A moment later, the sound changed.</p>
<p>The echo of the bay gave way to the deeper, hollow thunder of the tunnel. I felt the vibration of scanners hum through the truck’s frame. Light flashed dimly through the gaps.</p>
