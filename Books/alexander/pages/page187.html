<p>One roe deer, head down, scraping at the snow with a front hoof. Thin, but not skeletal. Steam puffed from its nostrils with each breath.</p>
<p>No others. Just that one, alone in the hollow like a misplaced thought.</p>
<p>I slid the rifle off my shoulder, movements slow and automatic. Stock to shoulder. Cheek to wood. The world narrowed until it was the animal’s chest, the beat between my breaths, the weight of my finger on the trigger.</p>
<p>Breath in. The air burned going down.</p>
<p>Breath out. On the pause at the bottom, I squeezed.</p>
<p>The gunshot punched a hole in the quiet. Birds exploded up out of some distant clump of branches, wings flapping frantically. The recoil nudged into my shoulder, familiar.</p>
<p>The deer jerked, stumbled sideways, legs kicking once before folding. It hit the snow and went still except for the steam rising from its body.</p>
<p>I waited, counting heartbeats, keeping the sights on it.</p>
<p>No movement. No struggle.</p>
<p>I lowered the rifle and made my way down, boots sliding a little on the slope.</p>
