<p>“So what do you want from me?” I asked. “You want me to just say ‘thanks for everything, old man, I’m gonna go die somewhere interesting now’? You want me to walk out tomorrow like this was a training camp and I just graduated?”</p>
<p>He held my gaze.</p>
<p>“I want you to answer one question honest,” he said. “Just one.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” I said. “Shoot.”</p>
<p>He pointed his spoon at me like a little ladle-gun.</p>
<p>“If it was just you,” he said. “No me. No Viggo. No barn. Just you and that bag and whatever’s left of your courage. What would you do?”</p>
<p>The answer was there immediately, like it had been sitting in my throat waiting for an excuse.</p>
<p>“I’d walk,” I said. “I’d… keep going. See what’s out there. See if there’s more than just different flavors of ruin. See if any of the stuff in those books wasn’t a total lie.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s your answer,” Karl said. “That’s the only one that counts.”</p>
<p>I looked down at my hands. They were scarred now. Callused. Not the soft, useless things I’d carried out of the safe zone.</p>
