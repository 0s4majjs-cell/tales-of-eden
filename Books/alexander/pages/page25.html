<p>That’s when I heard it.</p>
<p>Soft. Close.</p>
<p>Paws on snow.</p>
<p>If it had been boots, I think I would have forced myself up. Fight or run or at least pick a direction to die in. But it wasn’t. Just a light, steady crunch. A faint huffing breath.</p>
<p>Something warm nudged my ear.</p>
<p>A wet nose pushed against my cheek, inhaled, then snorted. A rough tongue dragged once across my skin, hot compared to the air.</p>
<p>I pried my eyes open.</p>
<p>A dog stood over me. Medium-sized, thick fur matted with snow, ears pricked, head tilted slightly as it studied me. Brown eyes, sharp and alert. Not feral—too focused. Not starving—too solid.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I tried to say. It came out as a croak.</p>
<p>The dog huffed, like it had expected better.</p>
<p>I lifted my left hand a few centimeters off the ground. It trembled and dropped again.</p>
<p>“Go on,” I whispered, not sure if I was talking to the dog or myself. “Nothing good here.”</p>
