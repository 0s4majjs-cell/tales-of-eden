<p>Then an arm resolved out of the mess. Big. Longer than I was tall. Muscles in the wrong places, skin scorched and torn. The hand at the end of it had too many joints, fingers bent back at angles that looked painful even in death.</p>
<p>Once I saw one arm, I couldn’t stop seeing the rest.</p>
<p>Arms everywhere. Dozens. Some thick and roped with sinew. Some thin and whip-like. Some ending in hands, some in blunt, bony clubs, some tapering into nothing, fusing back into the main body as if they hadn’t quite finished growing.</p>
<p>The torso was a ruined mountain of flesh and bone, hunched and swollen. Parts of it were burned down to something that looked like black glass. Other parts glistened wet and raw.</p>
<p>The head… I guessed it was the head… was smashed into the ground at a breakneck angle. Jaw wrenched open, teeth bared, skull cracked in a web of fractures. One eye socket was just a crater filled with blood and sticky, blackened jelly.</p>
