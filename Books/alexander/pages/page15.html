<p>Halfway down, my fingers had gone numb. My legs burned. My right knee sent up sharp little protests every time I put weight on it. I kept going.</p>
<p>If I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.</p>
<p>When I finally stepped onto solid ground again, my legs went weak with relief. I had to lean against the wall for a second, knuckles white on the railing, to convince them we were done with the spiral.</p>
<p>The space at the bottom was nothing like the top.</p>
<p>The inside of the wall’s base had been turned into a kind of transport bay. A wide, low chamber with concrete floors and beams thick enough to hold up the world. Engines rumbled. Diesel and oil and cold air mixed into something that clawed at the back of my throat.</p>
<p>Trucks. A whole line of them. Big, ugly things with reinforced bumpers, cabs armoured in plates, backs covered in heavy tarps.</p>
