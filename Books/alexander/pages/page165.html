<p>I wrote about Enzo’s silence more than his jokes, Jonas’s throwaway comments about the world beyond the walls, Gretel’s way of shoving food at you like an insult that still kept you alive.</p>
<p>By the time my hand cramped, I felt… not better. But less full.</p>
<p>Two weeks in, sharp movements stopped sending lightning up my leg.</p>
<p>Twisting wrong still hurt like hell. Letting the cast touch the floor was a sharp warning I didn’t ignore. But I could sit, shift, even turn too fast without seeing white.</p>

<p>“Healing,” she said finally. “For now. You start touch down. Light. With crutches. If it hurts like first day, you stop. If it hurts like third day, you keep going. You feel anything move that shouldn’t, you scream.”</p>
<p>“Define scream,” I said.</p>
<p>“Loud enough I hear it,” she replied.</p>
<p>The first time my injured heel met the floor, every muscle in my body braced for impact.</p>
