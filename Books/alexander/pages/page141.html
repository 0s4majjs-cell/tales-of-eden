<p>Enzo waiting with his rifle and a “komm, Colt, move your ass.”</p>
<p>Out, through the gate. The world beyond changing in small ways—more snow one day, less the next; different tracks; a building that had collapsed a little more overnight with a sound nobody had been close enough to hear.</p>
<p>Hunts that went well. Hunts that didn’t. Some days we came back with deer, or a couple of rabbits, or a bird unlucky enough to be where Enzo’s patience and my aim lined up. Some days we came back with nothing but cold fingers and empty hands.</p>
<p>The routine after was always the same. Gates opening. Mira at the post, expression measuring and impassive. Meat taken to the butcher corner. Blood washed off hands in water that bit like knives. Weapons checked, cleaned, stored.</p>
<p>Afternoons were chores.</p>
