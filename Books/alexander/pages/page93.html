<p>Every step toward the valley floor felt exposed. My boots pressed into snow and brittle grass; the sound was too loud in the open air. No broken car bodies to hide behind. No trees thick enough to disappear into. Just me, the wind, and a line of walls full of strangers who had built their lives around <em>not</em> trusting voices from outside.</p>
<p>By the time I reached flatter ground, I knew they’d seen me. You didn’t build watch platforms that high and miss an idiot walking straight toward you.</p>
<p>I kept going until something in me locked and refused to take another step without permission.</p>
<p>“STEHEN BLEIBEN!”</p>
<p>The shout cracked across the valley from one of the platforms near what had to be the front gate. A heartbeat later, the same voice, rough German wrapped around careful English:</p>
<p>“Stop right there! Don’t move!”</p>
<p>My body obeyed before my thoughts did. I stopped dead.</p>
<p>“Hände hoch! Hands up! Over your head, jetzt!”</p>
