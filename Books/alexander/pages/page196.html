<p>Above the knee, there was a stump. Someone had tied something around it—looked like a shirt and a belt together, pulled so tight the fabric cut into the skin. It was soaked through, dark and shiny. Blood had run down and dried in thick clots. It was still leaking in slow, ugly pulses.</p>
<p>I dropped to my knees in front of her. My bad leg sent a lightning bolt of pain up my thigh. I barely felt it.</p>
<p>“Else,” I said. My voice sounded small. Wrong. “Hey. Hey, I’m here.”</p>
<p>Her head rolled a little toward the sound, like it was too heavy. Her eyes struggled to focus on my face.</p>
<p>For half a heartbeat I hoped she wouldn’t recognize me. That I’d be just some blurred shape, not anyone she could put a name on.</p>
<p>Her mouth twitched.</p>
<p>“Where…” The word came out shredded, half-soaked in blood. She coughed, a horrible bubbling sound, then forced the rest out. “…the fuck… were you…”</p>
<p>It hit harder than any slap.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth. Nothing came out.</p>
