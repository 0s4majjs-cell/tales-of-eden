<p>The cold had teeth today. It bit through the seams of my coat, found the thin places, went to work. My leg—the one the moose had tried to turn into modern art—ached in a dull, familiar way. Not sharp enough to slow me. Just enough to make sure I remembered.</p>
<p>The quiet felt wrong.</p>
<p>On decent days, there was always <em>something</em>: a crow yelling at nothing, a rabbit making a bad decision across open ground, the creak of a branch with too much snow on it. Today I could hear the fabric of my coat brush when I moved my arms, the rasp of my breath inside my scarf, and not much else.</p>
<p>“You’re being jumpy,” I told myself under my breath. “It’s winter. Animals sleep, remember? That’s a thing.”</p>
<p>Didn’t help much.</p>
<p>At the edge of the trees, I crouched and studied the ground. Old tracks mostly. Human boot-tread from patrols and scavenging runs. The narrow, hopping marks of a hare that had come through… days ago, maybe. Hard to tell. The snow had that crusted, wind-smoothed look.</p>
<p>I pushed into the trees anyway.</p>
