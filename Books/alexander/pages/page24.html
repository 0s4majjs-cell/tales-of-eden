<p>One second I was upright, the next my face was an inch from the ground, one cheek pressed into snow and gritty ice. The shock of it stole what little breath I had left.</p>
<p>I tried to push myself up. My right arm refused. My left arm shook like it wasn’t connected to anything useful.</p>
<p>I managed to get my head turned to the side enough not to inhale a mouthful of slush. That felt like a win, which said a lot about how the day was going.</p>
<p>The concrete under the snow radiated cold. It seeped into my skin, into the bruise on my hip, into my spine. Every exhale hung in the air and drifted away.</p>
<p><em>Get up,</em> some small part of me insisted. <em>If you sleep here, that’s it.</em></p>
<p>The rest of me was done taking orders.</p>
<p>My thoughts unraveled, thread by thread, until only the simplest signal remained.</p>
<p>Sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep would be easier. Sleep would be… quiet.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long I lay there. Long enough for feeling to pull back from my fingers and toes like a tide. Long enough for the edges of my vision to blur.</p>
