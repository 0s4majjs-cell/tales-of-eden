<p>They weren’t proper forest trees, like in the books. Too thin, too far apart. Black trunks, bare branches, bark peeling here and there where people had stripped it for kindling. The snow muffled everything, turning my steps into dull crunches.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes in, I found the first wrong thing.</p>
<p>Half a hare.</p>
<p>Back end only, lying in the snow with its spine snapped clean, guts spilled out and frozen mid-splash. The front half wasn’t anywhere. No scatter of fur. No blood trail. Just… gone.</p>
<p>I stared at it longer than I should’ve.</p>
<p>A fox would’ve left tracks, at least a sign of a struggle. A bird would’ve left a mess. This looked like something had just picked up the front half and removed it from reality.</p>
<p>“Could’ve been a while,” I muttered. “Wind erases tracks. That’s normal.”</p>
<p>Normal. Sure.</p>
<p>I stepped around it and kept going.</p>
<p>The quiet pressed in harder. Once, something shifted under the snow off to my right, then went still. A branch creaked overhead, slow and complaining. That was it.</p>
