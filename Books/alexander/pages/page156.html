<p>As Else reached for a saw and more splints, painkillers already in her other hand, I let my head drop back against the table.</p>
<p>The last thing I saw before the world blurred was Enzo in the doorway, shoulders slumped, hands on his knees, eyes on me like he wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or annoyed.</p>
<p>Then the injection hit, warm and dark, and the pain loosened its grip just enough for everything to go soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Somewhere, under all of it, a stupid thought floated up.</p>
<p><em>At least Karl would say I’m doing it right. If you’re going to live out here, break something real at least once.</em></p>
<p>Then even that slipped away.</p>
<p>Pain brought me back first.</p>
<p>Not all at once. Just enough to remind me my leg existed and hated me.</p>
<p>I floated in and out of a warm, heavy dark. Voices came and went on the surface—muffled, distant.</p>
<p>“…hold him still…”</p>
<p>“…it’s set, stop hovering…”</p>
<p>“…if he tears it again, I’m not wasting more plaster…”</p>
