<p>Karl stood by the fence, one hand on a post, the other scratching Viggo’s neck. The dog whined, clearly offended by this whole development.</p>
<p>“You’re not taking him,” Karl said, before I could even start to ask.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything,” I protested.</p>
<p>“You <em>thought</em> it,” he said. “He’s useful. You’re still optional.”</p>
<p>“Rude,” I said. “I thought I was family.”</p>
<p>“Family visits,” Karl said. “Doesn’t steal the dog.”</p>
<p>I grinned despite the cold gnawing at my insides.</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said. I looked out at the white fields, the broken lines of distant buildings, the thin black veins of roads leading nowhere good. “Guess this is it.”</p>
<p>“For now,” Karl said.</p>
<p>“For now,” I echoed.</p>
<p>He pushed off the post and stepped closer, squinting at me like he was checking for loose screws.</p>
<p>“Repeat it back,” he said.</p>
<p>“What, the survival rules?” I asked.</p>
<p>“All of it,” he said. “Humor an old man.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes, but started ticking them off on my fingers.</p>
