<p>Pipes ticking. Footsteps in the corridor. Distant voices. A door slamming. The faint hum under it all from whatever kept the power on.</p>
<p>“Either go,” I told myself quietly, “or unpack.”</p>
<p>My fingers tightened on the strap.</p>
<p>I went.</p>
<p>No dramatic goodbye. No note. No last look around the room. If I started saying farewell to anything, I might not stop.</p>
<p>I slung the bag over my shoulder, stepped into the corridor, and joined the flow of bodies moving nowhere important.</p>
<p>Nobody stopped me. Nobody asked.</p>
<p>Inside the yard, I peeled off. Cut through two alleys, one maintenance corridor, and around the back of a storage block until the walls stopped being something above the buildings and started being the only thing in front of me.</p>
<p>The air felt colder near them. It always did. People said the shield systems under the concrete made the air thin. People said a lot of things.</p>
