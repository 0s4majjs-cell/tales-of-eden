<p>I started watching the trees more than the ground. Looking for broken branches, stripped bark, anything to prove the world still had moving parts.</p>
<p>Found it a little later: claw marks on a trunk.</p>
<p>Four deep grooves, sliding down the wood from just above my shoulder height. The bark was fresh-peeled, pale underneath, sap frozen in little glassy beads.</p>
<p>“Boar?” I whispered. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>I pressed my gloved hand into one of the grooves without really thinking about it.</p>
<p>My fingers disappeared almost to the knuckle.</p>
<p>I pulled my hand back, flexing it like that would shake the feeling off.</p>
<p>Turning back crossed my mind in a real way for the first time. Walking straight back to Rustfield, finding Mira, saying: <em>“Forest feels wrong. Hunting’s a bad idea today.”</em></p>
<p>I could already hear the answer, though. <em>“Forest always feels wrong, Colt. We still need to eat.”</em></p>
<p>So I kept going.</p>
