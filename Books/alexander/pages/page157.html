<p>Sometimes I caught a laugh I thought was Jonas. Once I heard Enzo swear softly in whatever language he swore in when German didn’t cut it.</p>
<p>Every time I came up properly, the pain was a little clearer.</p>
<p>At first it was a deep, dull throb somewhere around my shin, wrapped in cotton and stone. Later it turned sharp at the edges, like the bone itself was breathing against the cast.</p>
<p>The first time I really woke, the ceiling over me was stained boards and a greasy strip of sheet metal. Else’s clinic. A small stove glowed orange in the corner. The air smelled like disinfectant, boiled herbs, and people who’d been sick in here before me.</p>
<p>Else stood beside the bed, hair tied back, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Her hands were on my leg, fingers pressing along the thick plaster.</p>
<p>“Welcome back,” she said, as if I’d just overslept.</p>
<p>My throat felt like I’d swallowed sand.</p>
<p>“How bad?” I croaked.</p>
<p>She handed me a cup first. “Drink. Then talk.”</p>
<p>The water was lukewarm metal and dust. It tasted incredible.</p>
