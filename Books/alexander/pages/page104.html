<p>Fires burned in chopped-down barrels. People warmed their hands over them, glancing up as we passed. Some stared, assessing. Some looked away as soon as my eyes met theirs. I caught pieces of words from clusters—hard consonants, soft vowels, familiar curses. Faces in every shade winter would allow.</p>
