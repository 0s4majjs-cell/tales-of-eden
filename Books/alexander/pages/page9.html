<p>Seeing eight of them this close made the part of me that wanted to live sit up and scream.</p>
<p>The part that had packed the bag walked me closer.</p>
<p>Not directly. That would’ve been suicide even by my standards. I circled, keeping to the shadows of storage sheds and parked cargo haulers, testing how close I could get before anyone really looked at me.</p>
<p>Close enough to hear the hum of the elevator through the steel. Close enough to see frost collected in the seams of their armor.</p>
<p>Not close enough to get away with this if they were paying attention.</p>
<p>The thing about people who did the same shift every day, though? They got good at ignoring what they thought they understood.</p>
<p>I waited until one of the 74’s glanced back toward the inner yards, looking at something I couldn’t see. Until two of the others shifted their rifles to talk quietly. Until the floodlights were in just the right place to throw a lane of deeper shadow across the concrete.</p>
<p>Then I ran.</p>
