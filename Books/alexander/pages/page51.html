<p>Karl snored like an old generator on low power. Viggo, who had decided at some point that my doorway belonged to him, huffed and shifted every time the wind rattled the boards. I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling, replaying Karl’s words.</p>
<p><em>You’re starting to look like my son.</em></p>
<p>Nobody had ever said anything like that to me.</p>
<p>Nobody had ever really said much about me at all.</p>
<p>At some point, my thoughts blurred and I dropped into shallow, jittery sleep. When Karl shook my shoulder awake, it felt like I’d just blinked.</p>
<p>“Up,” he said. “We’re going out.”</p>
<p>I squinted at him. “Morning to you too.”</p>
<p>“Sun’s already working,” he replied. “Try and keep up.”</p>
<p>Outside, the cold bit harder than usual. The sky was a heavy, colorless smear, the kind that promised more snow but hadn’t committed yet. Karl handed me my rifle and slung a larger one over his shoulder. Viggo danced in dumb, excited circles, tongue lolling, like we were heading to a picnic instead of the ruins.</p>
