<p>We passed under the twisted remains of a billboard frame. The half-rotten plastic still hanging from it showed three smiling people holding soda bottles, all teeth and perfect skin and mid-laugh. The slogan at the bottom read: TASTE THE FUTURE. Someone had spray-painted over it in red: WE DID.</p>
<p>I eyed it. “That aged well.”</p>
<p>Karl followed my gaze. “Future usually tastes worse than the ads.”</p>
<p>“Not sure the past did much better,” I said.</p>
<p>Karl made a noncommittal sound. “Past at least had the decency to stay where it belonged.”</p>
<p>We ducked into what used to be a pharmacy. The sign above the door had lost most of its letters, so it just read: HAR A Y. Inside, shelves lay tipped over like fallen dominoes. Old plastic bottles and paper boxes lay scattered everywhere, labels faded, contents probably lethal.</p>
<p>“Rule of thumb,” Karl said, stepping over a heap of crumbled packaging. “If you find pills, you don’t recognize them, and the bottle’s older than you are, you leave them the hell alone.”</p>
