<p>Boards creaked. Someone walked past my door with a heavy tread. A cough hacked through the hall. Somewhere outside, metal clanged against metal in a rhythm that sounded like someone who’d been fixing the same thing for years.</p>
<p>I lay there for a minute and stared at the patched plastic over the little window. The light bleeding through was thin and grey, enough to turn the room from black to shapes.</p>
<p>For a second I didn’t recognize the shapes.</p>
<p>Bed. Shelf. Chair. My bag on the floor. The compass on the crate, needle holding north like it didn’t care where I was.</p>
<p>Then it all slotted back into place.</p>
<p>Rustfield. Not Berlin. Not Karl’s barn. New walls. New rules.</p>
<p>My body felt like it had been hit by something large. Which, technically, it had: travel, fear, the last few days’ worth of adrenaline. Muscles ached in new places. My feet hated me.</p>
<p>Still better than frozen concrete.</p>
