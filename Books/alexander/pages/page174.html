<p>Conversations got shorter. Jokes came slower. When I limped over to the fire where he and a few others sat after a long day, there was always a space, but it never quite felt like it was for me.</p>
<p>He still trained new hunters. Still went on runs. Still grumbled about everyone’s aim.</p>
<p>He just did it without looking my way as much.</p>
<p>I threw myself harder into whatever work I could do.</p>
<p>More maps. Cleaner logs. Long talks with Jonas on the wall at night when my leg could handle the stairs.</p>
<p>“Enzo mad at you?” Jonas asked once, after watching us not quite look at each other for a week.</p>
<p>“Disappointed,” I said. “Which is worse.”</p>
<p>Jonas made a face. “What did you do?”</p>
<p>“Opened my mouth,” I said.</p>
<p>He huffed. “He’ll get over it,” he said. “Or he won’t. Either way, you apologize when you mean it, not when you think he expects it.”</p>
<p>“When did you get wise?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not,” he said. “I just watched a lot of idiots never say sorry until it was at a grave.”</p>
<p>Six weeks in, Else cut the cast down.</p>
