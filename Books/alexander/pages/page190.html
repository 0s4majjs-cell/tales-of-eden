<p>For half a second my brain tried to file it as <em>old factory,</em> <em>burning dump,</em> anything but what it clearly was.</p>
<p>The wind shifted.</p>
<p>The smell hit.</p>
<p>Burning wood, burning plastic, burning… other things. A greasy, heavy stink that sat on the back of my tongue and wouldn’t move.</p>

<p>Thoughts came in flashes, not full sentences. <em>They’ll have it under control. Small fire. Mistake in the kitchen. They’ve got barrels of water. It’s fine.</em></p>
<p>The part of me that had gotten used to this world already knew better.</p>
<p>I ran.</p>
<p>The rifle thumped against my back, barrel smacking my shoulder blade with every uneven stride. Cold air tore down my throat. Pain jabbed up my bad leg with each footfall; I ignored it.</p>
<p>The closer I got, the worse the sky looked. The column of smoke broadened, spread out, turned into a dirty, glowing lid over where the camp should be. The orange underneath flickered and pulsed.</p>
