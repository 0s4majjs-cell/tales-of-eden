<p>A lanky figure with tangled hair sat on an overturned crate near the wall, guitar in his lap, fingers picking at strings that only half wanted to stay in tune. The sound drifted through the camp like it didn’t know if it was allowed.</p>
<p>None of them were the clean, pressed silhouettes from Berlin propaganda.</p>
<p>They were just… people. Scarred up, worn down, still moving.</p>
<p>“Colt!”</p>
<p>This time the shout came from the gate.</p>
<p>Enzo stood there, rifle strapped over one shoulder, coat zipped up to his throat, breath ghosting out in short bursts. He waved me over like I was late.</p>
<p>“You eat, oder was?” he called. Or what?</p>
<p>I lifted the empty bowl and wiggled it at him.</p>
<p>“Cleaned it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Gut,” he replied. “Then we work.”</p>
<p>Gretel took my bowl without looking, already filling another for the next person. I joined Enzo at the gate.</p>
<p>Mira was there too, talking with one of the wall guards. She raised a hand to stop us as we approached.</p>
<p>“Route?” she asked Enzo.</p>
