<p>Steel ribs and welded plates slid past through the small grated window. The hum of old machinery pressed up through the soles of my boots. Somewhere, wind found its way into the shaft, threading a cold draft down my neck.</p>
<p>I’d wanted to see the world beyond the walls my whole life.</p>
<p>This wasn’t how I’d pictured it.</p>
<p>The elevator jerked to a stop. The doors shuddered open.</p>
<p>Cold air hit me first. Real cold. Not the damp chill of badly heated concrete, but open, unfiltered winter.</p>
<p>I stepped out onto the top of the wall.</p>
<p>The city inside lay to my left, hunched under the grey sky. From up here it looked smaller. More fragile. Smoke rose from chimneys and broken vents in thin lines. The blocks blurred into each other: housing, admin, industrial. No faces from this height. Just a pattern.</p>
<p>To my right, beyond the outer edge, the world dropped away.</p>
<p>The ruins on the other side looked nothing like the propaganda footage.</p>
<p>No screaming monsters. No waves of teeth. Just broken buildings and snow.</p>
