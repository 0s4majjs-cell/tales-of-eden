<p>Air got hard to pull in. My chest worked, but the breaths came short and fast, not doing anything. My fingers started tingling. My face felt hot and numb at the same time.</p>
<p><em>If you’d gone back sooner.</em></p>
<p>If I’d listened to that instinct and turned around the moment the forest felt wrong. If I’d dropped the hunt and run home. If I’d been on the wall with a rifle when the first scream went up. Maybe I still would’ve died. Maybe I wouldn’t have changed a damn thing.</p>
<p>Didn’t matter.</p>
<p>All I could hear was Else’s voice: <em>Where the fuck were you…</em></p>
<p>I swallowed. It hurt.</p>
<p>“I was out there,” I said, because saying nothing felt worse. My voice shook. “You were here and I was out there.”</p>
<p>Enzo didn’t answer, obviously. The mutant didn’t move. The fire crackled and hissed and ate.</p>
<p>My hand moved on its own, reaching out to touch his sleeve. The fabric was stiff with dried blood. Still warm underneath.</p>
<p>I curled my fingers around his wrist.</p>
