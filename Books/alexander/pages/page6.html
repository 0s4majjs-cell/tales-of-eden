<p><em>If I’m going to die anyway, I don’t want it to be in a room that smells like mold and recycled air.</em></p>
<p>I closed the book.</p>
<p>My hands moved before the rest of me caught up.</p>
<p>I pulled my old bag from under the bed. Canvas, patched three times, strap threatening to quit. I dumped it on the mattress and started filling it.</p>
<p>Clothes—two changes, nothing bright. Ration packs I’d been hoarding one bite at a time. The small metal canister I used for water. The notebook and the pen that actually worked. A few pages of hand-sketched maps someone had traded me for extra soap: the Safe Zone, the surrounding ruins, guesses at roads.</p>
<p>Every so often my brain tried to interrupt.</p>
<p><em>Stupid.</em></p>
<p><em>Insane.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re going to get shot at the wall or freeze outside it.</em></p>
<p>My hands ignored it and kept going.</p>
<p>By the time I stopped, the bag was full and sitting on the bed, ready like it had been waiting for me to decide.</p>
<p>I stood there a long moment, listening to the building breathe.</p>
