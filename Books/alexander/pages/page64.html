<p>Karl didn’t look back at me. “Don’t rise to it,” he said under his breath.</p>
<p>Then, louder: “You fire that thing in here, son, and you’ll hit more glass than meat. Your barrel’s shaking. You sure you want to bet your life on that aim?”</p>
<p>The guy’s arms were shaking. Tiny, but noticeable now that Karl had said it. His finger wasn’t fully on the trigger, just hovering.</p>
<p>“Easy, Rex,” the woman murmured.</p>
<p>Rex. It sounded more like a nickname than a real one. I found myself wondering what his mother had actually called him in whatever city used to be home.</p>
<p>Karl shifted his stance slightly, never fully taking his eyes off them. “Look,” he said, “you don’t want a shootout. I don’t want a shootout. I’ve got a kid here who’s just learned how to hit a moose that doesn’t move much. I don’t want his first human target to be some idiot with a twitchy rifle and a bad nickname.”</p>
<p>“I heard that,” Rex said.</p>
<p>“Good,” Karl said. “Means your ears work. Now tell your hands to follow.”</p>
