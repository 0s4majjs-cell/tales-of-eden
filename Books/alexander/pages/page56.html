<p>“Especially if it says ‘extra strength.’”</p>
<p>“What about these?” I picked up a white bottle so chipped it only read ‘-tal Vit–’. I unscrewed the cap and sniffed. It smelled like old paper and dust.</p>
<p>Karl took it from my hand. “Multivitamins. Might be worth grinding into food. Or might make you puke your lungs out. We’ll test it on Viggo.”</p>
<p>Viggo sneezed loudly, as if offended.</p>
<p>“I’m kidding,” Karl told the dog. Then, to me: “We’ll test it in small doses. On you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good,” I said. “I always wanted to be a science experiment.”</p>
<p>“You already were,” Karl said. “You grew up behind the wall.”</p>
<p>“That’s… uncomfortably fair.”</p>
<p>We scavenged quietly for a while. Karl showed me what to look for: sealed packets that hadn’t bloated with moisture, glass bottles with unbroken caps, sterile bandages sealed in plastic.</p>
<p>At one point I picked up a little plastic bag of brightly-colored tablets shaped like stars.</p>
<p>“What about these?” I asked. “They look like candy.”</p>
