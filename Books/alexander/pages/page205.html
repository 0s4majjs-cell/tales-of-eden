<p>Nothing. No pulse. Just the weight of his arm, the dead slackness in the tendons.</p>
<p>I let go. My hand shook when I pulled it back.</p>
<p>I wanted to scream. To punch something. To collapse. To rewind time by a few hours and do everything differently.</p>
<p>None of that happened.</p>
<p>Instead, I just knelt there on the cracked concrete next to Enzo and the dead mutant, hands hanging uselessly between my knees, breath coming too fast and not deep enough, eyes stinging.</p>
<p>Smoke drifted low, stinging my nose, making the ash and the snow look the same where they settled on the ground.</p>
<p>Three months ago, the worst thing I’d seen up close was a broken nose in a ration fight.</p>
<p>Now I knew what it looked like when a person came apart in two different places. I knew what it sounded like when someone died angry at me. I knew what it smelled like when a whole camp lost.</p>
<p>And somewhere under the shock and the static and the smoke, one thought dug in and refused to move:</p>
<p><em>You weren’t here when it happened.</em></p>
<p>I didn’t cry.</p>
