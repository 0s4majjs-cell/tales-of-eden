<p>I sat back on the bed, propped the notebook against my knees, and opened it to a blank page. For a moment, the emptiness stared back at me. Then the words started to come. The walls, the elevator, the truck, the fall, the dog. The fear and the ridiculousness and the fact that I was still somehow here.
