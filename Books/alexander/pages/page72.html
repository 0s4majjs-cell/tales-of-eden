<p>“I don’t…” I started, then stopped. “I don’t know yet.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit,” he said.</p>
<p>I blinked. “That’s rude.”</p>
<p>“It’s accurate,” Karl replied. He picked up his spoon again but didn’t eat, just stirred the stew in small, slow circles. “You’ve known since the day you packed that bag back at the wall. You just don’t like the answer.”</p>
<p>I shifted in my chair, irritation and guilt bumping shoulders. “Alright, since you’re apparently psychic, what’s my answer?”</p>
<p>“You want to keep walking,” he said simply. “Further out. New places. More ruins. Maybe find out if the ocean is still where they left it.”</p>
<p>The stupid part was: hearing him say it pissed me off because it was exactly right.</p>
<p>“You say that like it’s a crime,” I muttered.</p>
<p>“Did I say it was a crime?” Karl asked. “Did I pull a gun on you and shout ‘dreaming is illegal now, hands where I can see them’?”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” I said. “Day’s still young.”</p>
<p>He smirked, but it faded quick. His eyes dropped to his bowl, then back up to me.</p>
