<p>The street was empty. Office blocks on both sides, glass long gone from their windows. Old signage hung at crooked angles from facades eaten by rust. Snow had crept in everywhere it could.</p>
<p>No people. No smoke. No lights. No movement but the drifting flakes.</p>
<p>My breath steamed in front of me. I could see it because nothing else in the air was moving.</p>
<p>For the first time since I’d stepped into the elevator, the reality of what I’d done settled in properly.</p>
<p>No walls. No speakers. No ration lines.</p>
<p>Also no beds. No fences. No guards whose worst habit was being bored.</p>
<p>Just whatever was left.</p>
<p>“Great job,” I told myself, voice rough. “You made it.”</p>
<p>The cold was already sneaking into the tears in my coat. My fingers were starting to go numb again.</p>
<p>Standing still wasn’t an option. There was nowhere to stand.</p>
<p>So I picked a direction that didn’t have a collapsed bridge blocking it and started walking.</p>
<p>The city swallowed me without effort.</p>
