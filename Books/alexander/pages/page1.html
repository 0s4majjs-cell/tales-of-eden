<p>The [[codex:loc-berlinsfz|walls]] were the first thing I saw every morning.</p>
<p>If I leaned out of my window far enough, I could see a slice of them—the grey curve of steel plates stacked on each other, climbing higher than any building in the block. They never moved. Weather changed, people got older, ration lines shifted, but the walls were always there, cutting the world in half.</p>
<p>Inside: us. Outside: everything we were taught not to think about.</p>
<p>The speaker in the corridor crackled to life at 06:00. It always did. Thin voice, recorded decades ago, telling us the same things in the same order. Work rotations. Water use. Curfew reminders. Penalties. There was something comforting about knowing every word before it came.</p>
<p>Comforting, until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>I stared at the ceiling and let the announcements wash over me. I knew I should get up. Instead, I lay there and counted the cracks in the plaster like I hadn’t already done that a hundred times.</p>
