<p>“Altbau,” she said. Old building. “Before all this.”</p>
<p>Inside, the air was warmer. Not comfortable, but warmer. The hallway walls were scarred but solid. Doors lined both sides, some open to show glimpses of cramped rooms: bunks, blankets, small piles of personal junk.</p>
<p>She stopped at a door halfway down and pushed it open.</p>
<p>The room on the other side was small. Bed, not just a cot. Actual mattress, thin but there. A shelf cobbled together from crates. A chair. A nail in the wall with a hook for a coat. A little square of window patched with cloudy plastic that let in a smear of grey light.</p>

<p>A bed that was <em>mine.</em> A door that closed from the inside.</p>
