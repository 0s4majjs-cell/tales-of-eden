<p>For the first time since I’d left Karl’s barn, I had enough safety, light, and energy in the same place to write.</p>
<p>I stretched out on the bed for a moment instead, staring at the patched window.</p>
<p><em>You wanted out,</em> I thought. <em>You got it. You wanted a story you could live in. Well. Here you are, chapter whatever this is.</em></p>
<p>I let my eyes close, just for a second.</p>
<p>I’d think about what came next after I could feel my hands again.</p>
<p>For now, I had something I hadn’t had since Berlin.</p>
<p>A room. Four walls. A door.</p>
<p>Not a cell.</p>
<p>A place to breathe.</p>
<p>And, for a little while at least, to rest.</p>
