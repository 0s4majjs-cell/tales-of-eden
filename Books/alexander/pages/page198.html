<p><em>Do something,</em> my brain kept insisting. <em>Stop the bleeding. Drag her somewhere. Call for—</em></p>
<p>There was no “somewhere.” No one to call for. Nothing left to stop.</p>
<p>I let her hand slip out of mine. The fingers flopped to the ground, palm up.</p>
<p>My gloves were smeared red. I wiped them on my coat without looking.</p>
<p>Something shifted inside my chest. Not a crack, exactly. More like the floor dropping a few centimeters without warning.</p>
<p>This was the first time someone had died <em>in front of me.</em> Not behind a wall. Not as a story. Not as a rumor that went around the mess line.</p>
<p>Else had looked at me, asked where the fuck I’d been, and then… stopped.</p>
<p>I pushed myself back up. My legs felt weird, like they didn’t quite belong to me.</p>
<p>The camp blurred into a mess of firelight and shadow. Shapes that might be bodies, might be debris. The air roared in my ears. My own heartbeat was too loud.</p>
