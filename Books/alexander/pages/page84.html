<p>I let out a shaky laugh. “You saying I can do another year of boot camp if I miss being yelled at?”</p>
<p>“Another year, two,” he said with a shrug. “Until I croak. Or you get sick of my cooking. Whichever comes first.”</p>

<p>“Liar,” he said.</p>
<p>We looked at each other a long moment. I didn’t hug him. He didn’t open his arms. It wasn’t that kind of thing. But something settled between us anyway. An understanding. A line that wasn’t a wall.</p>
