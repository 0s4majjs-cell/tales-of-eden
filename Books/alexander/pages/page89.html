<p>I got lost in places that didn’t even have names anymore. I misjudged distances, misjudged weather, misjudged my own limits. I almost froze once because I pushed an hour too long before making camp. I almost starved because I didn’t dare light a fire near a town I didn’t know.</p>
<p>Three months in, the problems were still there. I’d just gotten better at bleeding slower.</p>
<p>No violent encounters with humans. That still felt like luck more than skill. I’d seen shapes at a distance: a group moving along an old rail line, a handcart pushed over cracked asphalt, a flicker of light in a tower one night far off to the west. I always turned away. I didn’t wave. I didn’t call out.</p>
<p>I still hadn’t met a single mutant.</p>
<p>Part of me was relieved. The other part was confused.</p>
<p>Mutants were the reason the walls existed. The reason SED-4 had jobs. The reason kids in Berlin grew up looking at posters of twisted silhouettes ripping people apart in red ink.</p>
<p>Out here, it was just… quiet.</p>
