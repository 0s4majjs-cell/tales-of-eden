<p>The air in the room tasted like dust and metal and too many nights of bad sleep.</p>
<p>Eventually, I swung my legs over the side of the bed. The concrete was cold under my feet. My shoulder ached from the way I’d been lying. My bookshelf—salvaged planks bolted together crookedly—leaned in the corner, half-full of books and data-slates with flickering screens.</p>
<p>Most people I knew read just enough to pass inspections. I’d read until my eyes hurt.</p>
<p>It was the only way to leave without actually going anywhere.</p>
<p>I pulled on my clothes, strapped my ration card to my belt, and stepped into the corridor.</p>
<p>Same as always: flaking paint, condensation on the pipes, people moving in a slow, resigned line toward the stairs. Someone’s kid cried three doors down. Someone else hushed them too sharply, the way you do when you’re more afraid than angry.</p>
