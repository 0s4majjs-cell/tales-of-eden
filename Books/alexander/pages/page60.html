<p>I stopped. My hand slid toward the rifle strap on instinct.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I whispered.</p>
<p>Karl didn’t answer right away. His eyes tracked something I couldn’t see yet, head cocked just slightly. Then he jerked his chin toward a half-collapsed storefront ahead, glass doors long shattered.</p>
<p>“Voices,” he said quietly. “Two. Maybe three.”</p>
<p>I held my breath, listening. At first there was only the wind, the hum in my own ears. Then, faintly:</p>
<p>“…told you this block was cleaned already—”</p>
<p>“—yeah? Tell that to my empty bag, smartass—”</p>
<p>Human. Casual. Too casual.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” he said. “But they’re between us and the way we came, and I’m not walking you blind into a different problem behind us.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do?”</p>

<p>“That’s a terrible plan.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only one we’ve got.”</p>
