<p>“You a bandit,” he asked, his voice low and rough, “or just stupidly lost?”</p>
<p>“Lost,” I croaked automatically. “I’m just… lost.”</p>
<p>The barrel didn’t waver. His eyes, dark and steady, stayed on my face.</p>
<p>“Lost how?” he pressed.</p>
<p>It took my brain a second to catch up.</p>
<p>“I… I fled from the [[codex:loc-berlinsfz|Berlin Safe Zone]],” I said.</p>
<p>The words felt strange, pulled into the open like a confession.</p>
<p>One of his eyebrows ticked up.</p>
<p>“The Berlin Safe Zone?” he repeated. “You’re a long way from home. And ‘fled,’ huh?”</p>
<p>Most people out here would’ve traded a limb for a spot behind those walls. Saying I’d left on purpose sounded almost insane out loud.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t necessarily say fled,” I backpedaled. “It was more of a… personal escape. The living conditions weren’t great. And it’s kind of been a dream of mine to see what’s out here.”</p>
<p>He made a sound that hovered somewhere between a grunt and a humorless chuckle.</p>
<p>“A dream,” he said. “Dreams are fine. Not my place to kill a man for having one.”</p>
