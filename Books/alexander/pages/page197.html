<p>I had answers: <em>Outside. Hunting. Doing what I was told.</em> They all sounded like excuses, even inside my own head.</p>
<p>“I…” My tongue felt thick. “I was out. I didn’t know. Else, I—”</p>
<p>Another cough tore through her. More blood. It sheeted out of the corner of her mouth, ran toward her ear. She tried to lift a hand to wipe it away and her arm trembled uselessly.</p>
<p>On reflex, I grabbed her hand. It felt cold. Too light.</p>
<p>Her fingers curled around mine, weak but insistent.</p>
<p>“Too…” She swallowed, eyes flicking away from my face to some point over my shoulder. “…late…”</p>
<p>Her hand clenched once, surprisingly hard. Nails bit into my skin through the glove.</p>
<p>Then her whole body jerked. Once. Her chest hitched.</p>
<p>The breath went out of her in a long, uneven sigh.</p>
<p>Another one didn’t come.</p>
<p>Her grip loosened. Her head sagged sideways. Her eyes stayed open, pupils blown wide, staring at nothing.</p>
<p>I sat there with her hand in mine a few seconds longer, like letting go was some kind of final admission.</p>
