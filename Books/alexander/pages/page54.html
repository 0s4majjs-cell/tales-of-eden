<p>When we reached the first collapsed storefront, Karl raised a hand and slowed down.</p>
<p>“Alright,” he said. “Lesson for today.”</p>
<p>“Another one?” I grumbled. “Didn’t we do twelve months of ‘lessons for today’ already?”</p>
<p>“This is graduation material,” he said. “Different subject.”</p>
<p>I lifted an eyebrow. “Which is?”</p>
<p>“People.”</p>
<p>I stopped. “I thought you said we avoid people.”</p>
<p>“We do,” Karl said. “But avoiding doesn’t mean pretending they don’t exist. So today, you’re learning how to walk through a place they <em>might</em> be without getting shot, stabbed, recruited, or robbed blind.”</p>
<p>“So… all the fun social options,” I said.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” he said. “Stay close. Mouth shut unless I ask. Eyes open all the time.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of conditions.”</p>
<p>“You can add ‘staying alive’ to the list if it helps.”</p>
<p>“Fair point.”</p>
