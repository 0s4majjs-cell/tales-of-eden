<p>I didn’t know if it made me feel better or worse. But it felt like the kind of line that belonged in the story I was trying to write, the one where I was still alive long enough to tell it.</p>
<p>And for now, that was enough.</p>
<p>Next day slid into place like all the others: cold, white, and busy trying to kill us in small, creative ways.</p>
<p>We hunted. We checked the traps. We skimmed the tree line for tracks and trouble. Karl pointed out signs I would’ve missed a year ago—a broken twig here, a smear of fur on bark there. We hauled in a rabbit, some stringy-looking bird, and a sad armful of firewood that smoked more than it burned. Viggo was smug the whole time, like he was the real brains behind the operation. He probably was.</p>
<p>By evening, the routine had folded itself neatly back into the house. Fire in the stove. Shadows on the walls. Two bowls of stew on the table.</p>
<p>The only thing that felt different was the way Karl kept looking at me when he thought I wasn’t paying attention.</p>
