<p>“Shut up, shut up—”</p>
<p>Karl stepped into the doorway, rifle in his hands but not quite aimed. I was right behind him, pulse hammering so hard I could feel it in my teeth.</p>
<p>Inside, two people straightened up from behind a long-dead counter. Both had guns. Both also had the universal <em>oh shit</em> look of people who hadn’t planned on company.</p>
<p>One was a woman in a patched coat, dark hair buzzed short on one side and hanging in her eyes on the other. She had a pistol, held in both hands but low.</p>
<p>The other was a lanky guy with a rifle and the posture of someone attached to bad decisions by habit. His curls were pulled back, his skin a few shades darker than mine, and when he muttered, I caught the faint roll of something that didn’t come from Berlin.</p>

<p>The woman eyed us. “That your idea of a greeting?” she asked. “Real warm.”</p>
