<p>The cold met me like an old enemy. The wind tugged at my coat. The world ahead was wide and broken and waiting.</p>
<p>For the first time since I’d left the Berlin Safe Zone, I wasn’t walking away from something.</p>
<p>I was walking <em>toward</em> it.</p>
<p>Traveling was quite the struggle at times. The kind that didn’t show up in stories.</p>
<p>You read about wandering the wastes and it sounds… clean. Long roads. Big skies. Maybe a dramatic storm if the author’s feeling generous.</p>
<p>Reality was different.</p>
<p>You had to keep moving, but never in straight lines. You had to look for food, but never stare too long at anything that might be watching you back. You had to sleep, but never deeply. Every choice was a trade: warmth or concealment, speed or safety, hunger or exposure.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it was a problem. A big one.</p>
