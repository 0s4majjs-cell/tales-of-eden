<p>A man with a shaved head and a welding mask pushed it up to wipe his forehead, revealing half a dozen burn scars. A young woman in a patched coat carried a crate of scrap past, lips cracked from the cold, hands bare. A little further down, an older guy in a wheelchair maneuvered himself toward a barrel fire, a blanket thrown over his legs, jaw working like he was chewing ghosts.</p>
<p>Nobody looked relaxed. Nobody looked surprised to see me either. Just one more body edging into their routines.</p>

<p>“Colt!”</p>

<p>Jonas leaned against a support beam near the gate lane, rifle slung, red strip around his arm. He was halfway through a chunk of bread, chewing like he’d forgotten what tasting was.</p>
<p>“Du lebst noch,” he said around it. You’re still alive. “Good sign.”</p>
<p>“I try not to make a habit of dying,” I said, walking over. “Morning.”</p>
<p>He nodded at my jacket, then at the sky.</p>
<p>“Eat yet?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Not yet, no.”</p>
