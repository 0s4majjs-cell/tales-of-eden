<p>The book I pulled down was old enough that some of the pages tried to come with it. The cover had long since given up. Inside were pictures of places I’d never seen—when the binding was still intact, at least. Forests with trees taller than the buildings here. Roads that cut through open land without a single guard post. An ocean, frozen mid-crash on the page.</p>
<p>I sat down on the bed, book open in my lap, and stared at a photograph of a beach. It was just sand and water and sky. No walls.</p>
<p>The thought arrived simple and clean, without drama.</p>
<p><em>I can’t do this for another twenty years.</em></p>
<p>Not rations. Not inspections. Not watching people vanish sideways out of lines. Not listening to the same voice on the speaker every morning until I started hearing it in my sleep.</p>
<p>I could have shoved it away. I’d done it before. Every time the walls felt too close, every time I walked the same route so many times it blurred.</p>
<p>This time I didn’t.</p>
<p>The thought sat there. Heavy. Solid.</p>
