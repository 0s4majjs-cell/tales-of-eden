<p>The moose filled the sight. It turned its head slowly, chewing. Its eye flicked in our direction once, briefly, then back to whatever its dumb brain cared about.</p>
<p>I slowed my breathing.</p>
<p>In. Out. In.</p>
<p>The wind brushed along my cheek. The world tightened down to crossing lines and meat and the thin space between.</p>
<p>I squeezed the trigger.</p>
<p>The shot cracked the cold open. A splash of dark red bloomed against the moose’s side.</p>
<p>It jerked, staggered, bellowed. The sound rattled my chest.</p>
<p>For a second I thought it might drop.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>It turned.</p>
<p>Not away. Not to run.</p>
<p>Up the slope.</p>
<p>Toward us.</p>
<p>“Shit,” I breathed.</p>
<p>“Run!” Enzo snapped.</p>
<p>I scrambled up, boots slipping in loose snow, rifle half-forgotten in my hands. The ground felt like it was moving under me. I made it three steps sideways before my foot hit a patch of ice hidden under powder.</p>
<p>I went down hard.</p>
<p>The world tilted. Sky, trees, animal, all at wrong angles.</p>
<p>I heard Enzo fire once, twice. The moose grunted, but its momentum didn’t change.</p>
