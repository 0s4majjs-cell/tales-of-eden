<p>Mira dropped a stack of old logbooks and a bundle of blank paper in front of me at the gate table one morning.</p>
<p>“Hunts,” she said, tapping one book. “Shifts.” Another tap. “Visitors.” A third. “They’re all mixed. Make them less stupid.”</p>
<p>I cracked one open.</p>
<p>It was chaos. Names I didn’t know. Places I’d never heard. Dated entries squeezed sideways into margins, three hands on the same page.</p>
<p>I sorted.</p>
<p>Columns. Notes. Cross-references.</p>
<p>Jonas drifted over on his break, leaned on his rifle and watched me draw neat little lines like this was some exotic ritual.</p>
<p>“You like this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Like is strong,” I said. “But it keeps my brain from chewing on itself.”</p>
<p>He pointed at the rough map we’d sketched together over a few days.</p>
<p>“See here,” he said, tapping three circles he’d drawn with a dull pencil. “And here. And here.”</p>
<p>Each mark sat on the edge of what passed for Rustfield’s territory.</p>
<p>“What are those?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Trouble,” he said. “Not yet. But soon.”</p>
<p>“Bandits?”</p>
