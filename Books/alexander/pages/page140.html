<p>Three roe again, feeding in a dip between two humps of snow. Not far from where yesterday’s had fallen, but not the same place. They lifted their heads almost in sync when the wind shifted.</p>
<p>Enzo looked at me, then pointed with his chin.</p>
<p>“You see?” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I murmured. “Same plan?”</p>
<p>“You go,” he said. “I watch your back. Remember, we bring something home, not glory.”</p>
<p>I crept to a low piece of concrete, lay prone, and lined up the shot.</p>
<p>Not much to say about it. Breath, sight, trigger, crack. One dropped. The others bolted.</p>
<p>Routine. Work.</p>
<p>On the way back, dragging the carcass between us, my shoulders burning, I realized that whatever else Rustfield was, it had a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Broken. Stressed. Too fast sometimes.</p>
<p>But it was a pulse.</p>
<p>The next eight days blurred into each other, the way days do when they’re full of the same motions and the same tired faces.</p>
<p>Morning porridge. Gretel’s threats. Jonas at the gate with a comment and a smirk.</p>
