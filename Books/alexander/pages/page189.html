<p>By the time I cleared the trees, my lungs burned and my shoulders felt like someone had been beating on them from the inside.</p>
<p>The sky was going dark properly now. Not the soft movie kind of twilight—just the light draining out, leaving everything flat and hard-edged. Clouds smeared low. No stars yet. The air had that hollow sound that meant the temperature was about to drop harder.</p>

<p>Smoke.</p>
<p>Not the thin, wandering thread of a cooking fire. A thick column, rising black at the base and dirty orange near the top. It twisted as it went up, lit from below like someone had shoved a piece of the sun into the valley floor.</p>
<p>Wrong spot. Wrong shape. Wrong everything.</p>
<p>I let go of the rope without realizing. The deer slid a little, bumping my heel.</p>
