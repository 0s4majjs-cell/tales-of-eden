The [[codex:loc-berlinsfz|walls]] were the first thing I saw every morning.

If I leaned out of my window far enough, I could see a slice of them—the grey curve of steel plates stacked on each other, climbing higher than any building in the block. They never moved. Weather changed, people got older, ration lines shifted, but the walls were always there, cutting the world in half.

Inside: us. Outside: everything we were taught not to think about.

The speaker in the corridor crackled to life at 06:00. It always did. Thin voice, recorded decades ago, telling us the same things in the same order. Work rotations. Water use. Curfew reminders. Penalties. There was something comforting about knowing every word before it came.

Comforting, until it wasn’t.

I stared at the ceiling and let the announcements wash over me. I knew I should get up. Instead, I lay there and counted the cracks in the plaster like I hadn’t already done that a hundred times.

The air in the room tasted like dust and metal and too many nights of bad sleep.

Eventually, I swung my legs over the side of the bed. The concrete was cold under my feet. My shoulder ached from the way I’d been lying. My bookshelf—salvaged planks bolted together crookedly—leaned in the corner, half-full of books and data-slates with flickering screens.

Most people I knew read just enough to pass inspections. I’d read until my eyes hurt.

It was the only way to leave without actually going anywhere.

I pulled on my clothes, strapped my ration card to my belt, and stepped into the corridor.

Same as always: flaking paint, condensation on the pipes, people moving in a slow, resigned line toward the stairs. Someone’s kid cried three doors down. Someone else hushed them too sharply, the way you do when you’re more afraid than angry.

We all shuffled out into Block E’s open yard a few minutes later. The sky was a dirty grey, daylight filtered through haze and old defense grids. The walls loomed over everything, close enough to feel like another row of buildings.

“Rations, move it!” a guard shouted, more out of habit than urgency.

I joined the line. Bodies pressed close around me, the smell of unwashed clothes and recycled soap thick in the cold. People stared straight ahead or at their own feet. Nobody talked unless they had to; sound carried too easily, and there were always ears you couldn’t see.

A woman three spots ahead of me held her card out wrong. The scanner beeped red. The guard barely looked up.

“Card,” he said.

“I—” Her voice came out thin. “There must be a mistake, I—”

“Card,” he repeated.

She fumbled. The scanner beeped red again. The guard’s jaw tightened. He lifted one hand and gestured, and two other guards peeled her out of the line.

She didn’t scream. That was the worst part. Just repeated, “Wait—wait—please—” as they dragged her toward the admin door.

Nobody moved. Nobody looked away. Nobody helped.

By the time it was my turn, my palms were slick.

The scanner flashed green over my card. A pack slid down the metal chute. I took it, stepped aside, and forced myself to breathe.

Inside the pack: my breakfast, my lunch, my dinner. Enough to keep one body going another day. Nothing wasted, nothing extra.

“Next!” the guard barked.

I walked back to my block with the others, feet matching theirs automatically. The woman who’d been pulled out was just gone. The line closed over the space she’d left like water.

Maybe she’d sort it out in admin. Maybe it really had been a mistake. Maybe.

I’d seen enough “mistakes” to know better.

Back in my room, I set the ration pack on the table and didn’t open it yet. Hunger could wait; it always did. My hand drifted to the shelf instead.

The book I pulled down was old enough that some of the pages tried to come with it. The cover had long since given up. Inside were pictures of places I’d never seen—when the binding was still intact, at least. Forests with trees taller than the buildings here. Roads that cut through open land without a single guard post. An ocean, frozen mid-crash on the page.

I sat down on the bed, book open in my lap, and stared at a photograph of a beach. It was just sand and water and sky. No walls.

The thought arrived simple and clean, without drama.

*I can’t do this for another twenty years.*

Not rations. Not inspections. Not watching people vanish sideways out of lines. Not listening to the same voice on the speaker every morning until I started hearing it in my sleep.

I could have shoved it away. I’d done it before. Every time the walls felt too close, every time I walked the same route so many times it blurred.

This time I didn’t.

The thought sat there. Heavy. Solid.

*If I’m going to die anyway, I don’t want it to be in a room that smells like mold and recycled air.*

I closed the book.

My hands moved before the rest of me caught up.

I pulled my old bag from under the bed. Canvas, patched three times, strap threatening to quit. I dumped it on the mattress and started filling it.

Clothes—two changes, nothing bright. Ration packs I’d been hoarding one bite at a time. The small metal canister I used for water. The notebook and the pen that actually worked. A few pages of hand-sketched maps someone had traded me for extra soap: the Safe Zone, the surrounding ruins, guesses at roads.

Every so often my brain tried to interrupt.

*Stupid.*

*Insane.*

*You’re going to get shot at the wall or freeze outside it.*

My hands ignored it and kept going.

By the time I stopped, the bag was full and sitting on the bed, ready like it had been waiting for me to decide.

I stood there a long moment, listening to the building breathe.

Pipes ticking. Footsteps in the corridor. Distant voices. A door slamming. The faint hum under it all from whatever kept the power on.

“Either go,” I told myself quietly, “or unpack.”

My fingers tightened on the strap.

I went.

No dramatic goodbye. No note. No last look around the room. If I started saying farewell to anything, I might not stop.

I slung the bag over my shoulder, stepped into the corridor, and joined the flow of bodies moving nowhere important.

Nobody stopped me. Nobody asked.

Inside the yard, I peeled off. Cut through two alleys, one maintenance corridor, and around the back of a storage block until the walls stopped being something above the buildings and started being the only thing in front of me.

The air felt colder near them. It always did. People said the shield systems under the concrete made the air thin. People said a lot of things.

Floodlights perched along the top, cold white eyes pointed down. Cameras turned lazily, their lenses dulled by age and grime. The base of the wall was lined with fences, sensor posts, warning signs in black and yellow.

And there, sunk into the steel itself: the elevator.

It was nothing special to look at. A metal box, blast doors closed, call panel blinking a tired green.

Most people in my block had never been this close to it. You needed the right kind of plastic around your neck to get within conversation distance. Or the right kind of job. Or the wrong kind of ideas.

Eight armored figures stood around it, spread in a loose arc.

74’s.

I’d grown up with posters of them: the heroes of the Safe Zone, standing in front of the walls with projectors firing behind them, monsters in silhouette. In real life they just looked tired. Heavy armor, matte and scarred. Full helmets with opaque visors. Rifles held in practiced rests.

Seeing eight of them this close made the part of me that wanted to live sit up and scream.

The part that had packed the bag walked me closer.

Not directly. That would’ve been suicide even by my standards. I circled, keeping to the shadows of storage sheds and parked cargo haulers, testing how close I could get before anyone really looked at me.

Close enough to hear the hum of the elevator through the steel. Close enough to see frost collected in the seams of their armor.

Not close enough to get away with this if they were paying attention.

The thing about people who did the same shift every day, though? They got good at ignoring what they thought they understood.

I waited until one of the 74’s glanced back toward the inner yards, looking at something I couldn’t see. Until two of the others shifted their rifles to talk quietly. Until the floodlights were in just the right place to throw a lane of deeper shadow across the concrete.

Then I ran.

Not full tilt at first. That would have been too obvious. A fast walk that turned into a jog that tipped over into a sprint.

By the time any of them really registered that I wasn’t moving like someone who belonged there, I was already halfway across the open ground.

“HEY!” one of them barked, voice muffled by the helmet. Sharp enough to cut through the wind anyway.

If I’d been smart, that would have been my cue to stop. Hands up. Apologize. Say I’d gotten lost.

I ran harder.

Boots slapped the concrete. I counted the steps without meaning to. Five. Ten. Fifteen. One of the 74’s moved to intercept, armor heavy but fast. A hand snatched for my hood and caught air as I ducked under it.

For a second the barrel of a rifle swung into my peripheral vision. My skin prickled. No shot came.

Someone shouted for me to stop in a voice that sounded like they were already bored of repeating it.

I slammed into the elevator’s panel hard enough to make it rattle.

The **up** button blinked dull green. I hit it.

Nothing.

The silence stretched out. I could feel their attention closing in like a fist.

“Come on,” I whispered through my teeth, and hit the maintenance override beside it. The one we weren’t supposed to know existed.

Something inside the wall clanked. The floor trembled. The doors juddered open just enough, then slid wider.

I stumbled inside and hit the panel again from the inside.

One of the 74’s lunged. His glove slammed against the door frame as it closed.

For a heartbeat we stared at each other through the narrowing gap—me, wide-eyed and sweating; him, visor blank and unreadable.

Then steel slid between us with a final, heavy thud.

The elevator lurched upward.

I sagged back against the wall, knees threatening to give out, heart thundering so hard it hurt. My hands were shaking. The bag dug into my shoulder.

Outside, unseen, the Safe Zone fell away.

The ride up was short. It felt like it took a year.

Steel ribs and welded plates slid past through the small grated window. The hum of old machinery pressed up through the soles of my boots. Somewhere, wind found its way into the shaft, threading a cold draft down my neck.

I’d wanted to see the world beyond the walls my whole life.

This wasn’t how I’d pictured it.

The elevator jerked to a stop. The doors shuddered open.

Cold air hit me first. Real cold. Not the damp chill of badly heated concrete, but open, unfiltered winter.

I stepped out onto the top of the wall.

The city inside lay to my left, hunched under the grey sky. From up here it looked smaller. More fragile. Smoke rose from chimneys and broken vents in thin lines. The blocks blurred into each other: housing, admin, industrial. No faces from this height. Just a pattern.

To my right, beyond the outer edge, the world dropped away.

The ruins on the other side looked nothing like the propaganda footage.

No screaming monsters. No waves of teeth. Just broken buildings and snow.

Towers snapped in half. Bridges cut short. Streets choked with debris and ice. Everything dead and white and wide.

The sky felt wrong. Too big. Like someone had pulled the ceiling off my life and forgotten to put anything else there.

For a second I just stood there, breathing clouds into the cold, bag strap biting into my palm.

Then the practical part of my brain spoke up.

*You’re on top of a seventy-meter wall with no idea how to get down, genius.*

The walkway stretched left and right, a narrow strip of metal lined with railings and the carcasses of old auto-turrets. A few 74’s moved in the distance, small dark shapes against the steel.

I kept low and headed away from the elevator, boots clanging softly, eyes scanning for anything that looked like stairs or a ladder or even a service hatch.

Guards passed twice, going the other way. Both times I dropped behind whatever cover I could find and held my breath while their footsteps scraped past.

My head was starting to pound by the time I found the door.

Half-hidden behind a dead turret housing, small enough to miss if you weren’t looking for it. Yellow paint flaked off the metal around it, leaving only fragments of the stencilled words.

**…INTENANCE ONLY**

Good enough.

The handle was stiff, but the lock might as well have been decorative. Two hard yanks and a curse later, it gave.

The door opened onto a narrow cylinder of space and a spiral of metal stairs clinging to its inside. No lights. Just thin grey filtering down from above and the suggestion of darkness below.

My stomach dipped.

“Sure,” I muttered. “Why not.”

I stepped onto the first stair. It creaked alarmingly and held. I kept one hand tight around the railing and started down.

Around and around, boots ringing on metal, breath fogging the air in front of me. The Safe Zone vanished behind the curve of the wall. The city beyond the walls slid into view in slices.

Halfway down, my fingers had gone numb. My legs burned. My right knee sent up sharp little protests every time I put weight on it. I kept going.

If I stopped, I wasn’t sure I’d start again.

When I finally stepped onto solid ground again, my legs went weak with relief. I had to lean against the wall for a second, knuckles white on the railing, to convince them we were done with the spiral.

The space at the bottom was nothing like the top.

The inside of the wall’s base had been turned into a kind of transport bay. A wide, low chamber with concrete floors and beams thick enough to hold up the world. Engines rumbled. Diesel and oil and cold air mixed into something that clawed at the back of my throat.

Trucks. A whole line of them. Big, ugly things with reinforced bumpers, cabs armoured in plates, backs covered in heavy tarps.

Workers in stained overalls moved between them, shouting over the noise. A few 74’s lingered near the tunnel mouth that led outward, checking manifests, waving vehicles through, occasionally banging on doors when drivers moved too slow.

I hugged the shadow of a support pillar and watched for a minute, trying to find the gap.

There was no door marked “freedom.” No unguarded side exit. Just trucks going one way: out.

So that was the answer.

I picked a target.

One of the trucks near the end of the line had its tarp only half-fastened at the back, canvas flapping with every small shift of the engine. Nobody seemed to care.

The tunnel ahead was open. The 74’s were focused on the front of the convoy. The workers were busy with checklists and hoses.

I slid along the wall, keeping low, heart punching at my ribs. My fingers were starting to tingle again, not from cold this time.

Three meters. Two. One.

When the truck started rolling, I moved.

Boots skidding on dust and oil, I ran alongside it and grabbed the tailgate. The metal was icy enough to burn. My feet left the ground.

For a breathless second I dangled there, nothing under me but moving concrete. The tunnel yawned ahead; the bay was already sliding past behind.

My shoulders screamed. The strap of my bag cut across my chest.

I hauled myself up in ugly, stuttering jerks. One knee over the edge, then the other, then a full-body heave that dumped me into the back of the truck.

I landed on my side hard enough to knock the air out of me.

No one shouted. No one banged on the side to tell the driver to stop.

I crawled to the flapping edge of the tarp, grabbed it, and dragged it down. It didn’t close perfectly, but it covered enough.

A moment later, the sound changed.

The echo of the bay gave way to the deeper, hollow thunder of the tunnel. I felt the vibration of scanners hum through the truck’s frame. Light flashed dimly through the gaps.

Then the hum stopped. The road opened up. The truck picked up speed.

When I lifted a corner of the tarp, there were no more walls in front of us. Just the broken road and the city’s corpse.

The Safe Zone shrank behind us, a smear of light in the distance.

I should’ve felt triumphant. Or terrified. Or something big enough to match what I’d just done.

Mostly, I felt cold. And suddenly, deeply tired.

I let the tarp drop and lay back on the empty metal bed, feeling every bump through my spine. Time blurred. The engine was a constant growl under everything. My thoughts drifted aimlessly between fear and static.

Eventually, the truck slowed.

The ride got rougher. More turns. More stops and starts. I peeked out again.

We’d left the wide highway behind. We were in the guts of the dead city now—narrower streets lined with tall ruins, snow piled in drifts against doorways and half-buried cars. No other vehicles. No lights.

If I stayed on, I had no idea where I’d end up. Some outpost. Some depot. Somewhere I’d be found and either shot, shoved back inside, or put to work under rules I didn’t know.

If I got off, I had… whatever this was. Ruins. Cold. Hunger.

Both options looked bad. Only one of them was mine.

I tightened the straps on my bag and dragged myself toward the tailgate.

The truck hit a pothole the size of a grave.

I didn’t so much jump as get thrown.

One moment I was crouched at the edge, waiting for the right rhythm. The next the floor kicked up under me and I was airborne, fingers clawing at nothing.

The road came up and hit me hard.

Pain exploded along my right side. My shoulder lit up white-hot. The impact knocked the breath out of me so thoroughly that for a second I honestly wondered if my lungs had just… stopped existing.

I bounced, rolled, scraped over ice and rough asphalt. The world became a jumble of grey and white and sharp edges. Something tore under me—clothing, skin, both.

Then it was over.

I ended up sprawled on my back, staring up at a sky that look exactly as uncaring from the outside as it had from the inside.

The truck’s tail lights were already moving away, red glows shrinking between ruined buildings. They didn’t slow. They didn’t stop.

I lay there, mouth opening and closing, trying to remember how to breathe.

Air finally forced its way back in, burning all the way down. I coughed, which hurt more.

“Okay,” I wheezed, to no one. “Okay. That… could have gone better.”

Every bit of me hurt. My right arm refused to cooperate when I tried to push myself up; a hot line of pain ran from my shoulder down into my ribs. My palms burned where skin had been scraped away. My hip throbbed. My face stung.

But nothing felt… loose. Not in the way it shouldn’t. My teeth were all still in my head. I could move both legs.

Small victories.

I rolled onto my left side and forced myself upright inch by inch.

The street was empty. Office blocks on both sides, glass long gone from their windows. Old signage hung at crooked angles from facades eaten by rust. Snow had crept in everywhere it could.

No people. No smoke. No lights. No movement but the drifting flakes.

My breath steamed in front of me. I could see it because nothing else in the air was moving.

For the first time since I’d stepped into the elevator, the reality of what I’d done settled in properly.

No walls. No speakers. No ration lines.

Also no beds. No fences. No guards whose worst habit was being bored.

Just whatever was left.

“Great job,” I told myself, voice rough. “You made it.”

The cold was already sneaking into the tears in my coat. My fingers were starting to go numb again.

Standing still wasn’t an option. There was nowhere to stand.

So I picked a direction that didn’t have a collapsed bridge blocking it and started walking.

The city swallowed me without effort.

Broken storefronts yawned to either side. Some still had faded posters clinging to their walls: smiling people holding products that never existed anymore. Cars sat at odd angles in the street, half-buried in snow and debris, windows smashed out, interiors stripped.

Once or twice I saw old blood stains in the snow, turned black and then buried and then half-revealed again by the wind. I tried not to think too hard about what had happened there.

Mostly, it was just empty.

The silence got inside my head. In the Safe Zone there was always noise—voices, machinery, announcements, the hum of the walls. Out here, my footsteps felt too loud. When I stopped, it was like the world held its breath with me.

Time got weird.

I walked until my brain stopped bothering with minutes and hours and just measured things in “before” and “after.”

Before my fingers stopped being able to feel the straps of my bag. After my right arm went from sharp hurt to a deep, sick ache. Before the light started to drain out of the sky. After I caught myself stumbling in a way I didn’t like.

My breath turned to a constant fog in front of me. My jaw ached from clenching. The cold wasn’t just on my skin anymore; it had settled inside my bones.

“Shelter,” I muttered at one point, mostly to keep my mouth moving. “Just one room. Four walls. Hell, I’ll take three.”

The city didn’t answer.

Every doorway I passed had its door ripped off, or its floors collapsed, or signs that someone else had been there recently and might come back. I was tired enough that even my paranoia felt slow, but not tired enough to bed down somewhere that said SAFE in big invisible letters even I could read.

By the time the sky went from grey to the deep pre-night blue, my thoughts were mostly just *cold* and *forward.*

My knees buckled without asking my opinion.

One second I was upright, the next my face was an inch from the ground, one cheek pressed into snow and gritty ice. The shock of it stole what little breath I had left.

I tried to push myself up. My right arm refused. My left arm shook like it wasn’t connected to anything useful.

I managed to get my head turned to the side enough not to inhale a mouthful of slush. That felt like a win, which said a lot about how the day was going.

The concrete under the snow radiated cold. It seeped into my skin, into the bruise on my hip, into my spine. Every exhale hung in the air and drifted away.

*Get up,* some small part of me insisted. *If you sleep here, that’s it.*

The rest of me was done taking orders.

My thoughts unraveled, thread by thread, until only the simplest signal remained.

Sleep.

Sleep would be easier. Sleep would be… quiet.

I don’t know how long I lay there. Long enough for feeling to pull back from my fingers and toes like a tide. Long enough for the edges of my vision to blur.

That’s when I heard it.

Soft. Close.

Paws on snow.

If it had been boots, I think I would have forced myself up. Fight or run or at least pick a direction to die in. But it wasn’t. Just a light, steady crunch. A faint huffing breath.

Something warm nudged my ear.

A wet nose pushed against my cheek, inhaled, then snorted. A rough tongue dragged once across my skin, hot compared to the air.

I pried my eyes open.

A dog stood over me. Medium-sized, thick fur matted with snow, ears pricked, head tilted slightly as it studied me. Brown eyes, sharp and alert. Not feral—too focused. Not starving—too solid.

“Hey,” I tried to say. It came out as a croak.

The dog huffed, like it had expected better.

I lifted my left hand a few centimeters off the ground. It trembled and dropped again.

“Go on,” I whispered, not sure if I was talking to the dog or myself. “Nothing good here.”

The dog ignored that. It looked back the way it had come, then at me again, then took two quick steps closer and pressed its shoulder against my ribs like it was testing how real I was.

Warmth bled through my torn coat.

Somewhere behind it, in the blur at the edge of my vision, I thought I saw a darker shape move against the snow. Taller. Human-sized.

Boots this time. Real ones.

My brain tried to get interested. Tried to decide if this was rescue or the opposite.

It didn’t manage.

The last thing I felt was the dog’s weight leaning into my side, solid and insistent, like it refused to let me drift all the way under.

Then everything went dark.

Warmth. That was the first thing my mind managed to process. Not the flat, mechanical heat of a safe-zone vent, but a softer, uneven warmth—fire, maybe. Something solid pressed against my back. A mattress. Thin, but a thousand times better than frozen concrete.

Light stabbed at my eyes when I forced them open. I blinked until the blur settled. I was in a small room with wooden walls—actual wood, darkened and warped with age. Faint cracks between the planks let in threads of cold air and the distant smell of snow. A small metal stove squatted in one corner, a fire crackling inside it, painting the room in unsteady orange.

No hum of generators. No flicker of LED strips. Just flame.

My right arm was wrapped in clean bandages, from wrist to shoulder. My chest, too. Someone had taken the time to patch me up. Someone had found me in the ruins and decided I was worth more than whatever bullets it took to put me down. That alone felt unreal.

On the small table beside the bed sat a glass of water and, next to it, an apple. A whole, actual apple. My stomach cramped at the sight.

I reached for the water first. My hand shook, but I managed not to spill as I brought it to my lips. The first swallow hurt—my throat was dry and sore—but the second felt like heaven. I drained the glass in seconds and set it down with a clumsy thunk.

Then I grabbed the apple. The skin broke under my teeth with a crisp snap. Juice flooded my mouth, cold and sweet and sharp. I devoured it in a handful of greedy bites, barely stopping to breathe. I hadn’t realized how hungry I was until that first taste hit my tongue.

When all that remained was the gnawed core, I dropped back against the pillow, staring up at the dark ceiling beams. The pain in my body had faded from blinding into a deep, persistent ache. My legs, though, felt strange—cramped and distant and wrong.

An ugly thought crept in. *What if I can’t move them?*

I swallowed, suddenly more afraid than I’d been at the wall. If I’d crippled myself my first day outside…

A bitter little laugh escaped me.

“…might as well just end it,” I muttered.

It came out more defeated than dramatic. The idea of being trapped in my own body, useless in a world built out of teeth, was worse than dying on that street.

Before the thought could really settle, I heard it: the slow, measured creak of footsteps on old wood. They drew closer, each one careful but heavy, heading straight for the door. My muscles tensed on reflex. Whoever this was had saved me. They’d also, technically, kidnapped me.

The handle turned. The door opened.

A man stepped in. He looked like someone the world had sanded down over a long time and hadn’t quite finished with. Middle-aged, maybe older, with a grey beanie pulled low over dark, messy hair and a beard that fell halfway down his chest. His clothes were rough and practical—thick fabric, faded from use, stained with dirt and smoke and work.

“You seem to be alright now,” he said.

That’s when I saw the pistol in his hand. It was pointed directly at me.

My mouth went dry.

“You a bandit,” he asked, his voice low and rough, “or just stupidly lost?”

“Lost,” I croaked automatically. “I’m just… lost.”

The barrel didn’t waver. His eyes, dark and steady, stayed on my face.

“Lost how?” he pressed.

It took my brain a second to catch up.

“I… I fled from the [[codex:loc-berlinsfz|Berlin Safe Zone]],” I said.

The words felt strange, pulled into the open like a confession.

One of his eyebrows ticked up.

“The Berlin Safe Zone?” he repeated. “You’re a long way from home. And ‘fled,’ huh?”

Most people out here would’ve traded a limb for a spot behind those walls. Saying I’d left on purpose sounded almost insane out loud.

“I wouldn’t necessarily say fled,” I backpedaled. “It was more of a… personal escape. The living conditions weren’t great. And it’s kind of been a dream of mine to see what’s out here.”

He made a sound that hovered somewhere between a grunt and a humorless chuckle.

“A dream,” he said. “Dreams are fine. Not my place to kill a man for having one.”

The pistol lowered. He slid it into a worn holster at his side. My lungs remembered how to work.

“But you’d better brace yourself,” he added, looking me over like he was appraising old equipment. “If the living environment wasn’t good there, you’ve walked yourself straight into hell. Out here? It’s worse. A lot worse. And from the looks of you…” His gaze lingered on my bandaged arm, my too-thin frame. “…you won’t last a month.”

He wasn’t cruel about it. Just honest. Somehow, that stung more.

Shame and frustration twisted together in my chest. I dropped my gaze to the blanket, fingers curling weakly into the fabric. I’d almost died my first day outside. It was hard to argue with his assessment.

“Can you move?” he asked after a moment.

“Not really,” I admitted. “My legs feel numb. They’re cramped, though. Feels… wrong.”

Before he could answer, something slipped around his leg and into the room. A dog—medium-sized, with a shepherd’s build and an alert, clever face—trotted straight over to the bed. Its fur was a mix of browns and blacks, thick and rough. It sniffed at my hand, then my chest, tail giving a cautious wag.

The man sighed, a sound heavy with equal parts annoyance and fondness.

“Figures,” he muttered.

Despite everything, I smiled. Carefully, I lifted my left hand and scratched behind the dog’s ear. It leaned into the touch immediately, tail wagging harder. The simple warmth of its body against mine felt almost unreal.

“What’s your name, boy?” the man asked.

“Alexander,” I said. “Alexander Colt.”

“Colt?” he repeated, something flickering behind his eyes for a heartbeat. Whatever memory it sparked, he let it go. “Name’s Karl Ottermand. That shepherd there is Viggo. He helps me scavenge what’s left.”

Viggo. The name suited him. He licked my fingers once, decisively.

“Nice to meet you, Karl,” I said. “How long was I out?”

Karl glanced at the watch on his wrist. “’Bout eight hours,” he said.

Eight hours. I’d gone from almost dying in the snow to lying in a warm bed in less than half a day. My life had turned into one of the stories I used to read—only my arm hurt too much for it to feel fictional.

“You get some rest, boy,” Karl said, adjusting the strap of his holster. “Once you’re steady on your feet, I’ll teach you how to stay alive out here. Got it?”

The offer was so sudden I almost missed it.

“Got it,” I replied.

He gave a short nod, whistled once. Viggo hopped off the bed and trotted to his side. Karl stepped out, holding the door open for the dog, then pulled it closed behind them.

I stared at the door for a long second, then sank back into the pillow. Saved by a stranger. Fed, patched up, offered survival lessons. Luck, I thought, might not hate me completely after all.


Morning announced itself as a thin bar of light slipping through a tear in the faded curtain. My body ached, but in a different way—less like I’d been smashed into asphalt and more like I’d slept too long in one position. Tentatively, I swung my legs over the side of the bed.

The wooden floor was cold under my feet. I held my breath and pushed myself upright. My legs wobbled, but they held. Relief hit so hard it made me dizzy. I wasn’t paralyzed. Just battered.

Slowly, using the wall for balance, I shuffled to the door and eased it open. The smell hit me before anything else.

Stew.

Rich, savory, heavy with herbs and something meaty. The scent wrapped around me like another blanket. My stomach made a noise I refused to acknowledge.

I followed it down a short hall into a larger room. Karl was crouched beside a small wood-burning stove, stirring a blackened pot. Steam billowed out as he lifted the lid, bringing the smell with it. Viggo lay curled up on a threadbare couch nearby, one ear perked lazily.

“You’re awake,” Karl said without looking up.

“Yeah,” I replied, hugging myself against the cold. “Isn’t it a little early for stew?”

“It’s winter,” he said flatly. “You’ve got a fever. And getting out of bed’s a stupid idea. I’ll bring it to you when it’s ready.”

There was no room for argument in his tone.

“Right. Uh… thanks,” I said, and retreated back to my room.

When I came in, something on the desk caught my eye. My notebook. And next to it, my favorite pen. Someone—Karl, obviously—had dug them out of my bag and set them within reach.

If I was really going to turn my life into a story, there was no better time to start.

I sat back on the bed, propped the notebook against my knees, and opened it to a blank page. For a moment, the emptiness stared back at me. Then the words started to come. The walls, the elevator, the truck, the fall, the dog. The fear and the ridiculousness and the fact that I was still somehow here. My handwriting was shaky, slanting harder than usual, but my hand didn’t stop moving.

About ten minutes later, the door creaked open again. Karl stepped in, balancing a wooden board across his hands. On it sat a steaming bowl of stew and a carved spoon. In his other hand, he held a glass of milk.

He set the board over my legs and placed the bowl carefully on top. The milk went on the desk beside the notebook. Steam curled up from the stew, carrying the smell of herbs and slow-cooked meat.

“Thank you,” I said, meaning it more than I expected.

“No problem, boy,” he replied. His eyes flicked to the notebook and pen. “What are you writing?”

“My dream,” I said.

He raised an eyebrow. I blew on a spoonful of stew to buy myself a heartbeat. It tasted even better than it smelled—earthy and rich, with chunks of mushrooms and something that was definitely meat and not something I wanted to think too hard about.

“I’ve always wanted to be part of a story,” I explained. “Reading’s been my way of… escaping. So I figured I’d write one I can actually live in.”

Karl’s expression softened by a degree.

“So that’s what you meant by ‘personal escape,’ huh?” A low chuckle scraped out of him. “No shame in that.”

He nodded once, thoughtfully. “I’m guessing you’re writing a story you can stand being in.”

“Yahtzee,” I said, lifting the spoon in a small salute before taking another mouthful.

“This is amazing,” I added between bites, unable to hide my surprise. “What did you put in it?”

“Herbs. Bit of ground beef. Mushrooms Viggo sniffed out. Greens from the greenhouse,” he said, shrugging one shoulder. Then his tone shifted, steady and serious. “But let’s have a real talk.”

I felt my shoulders tense. “Okay…?”

“Once that fever’s gone,” he said, looking me straight in the eye, “we’re starting your guide to survival.”

The way he said it made it sound less like an offer and more like a sentence. I nodded anyway.


The fever lingered for a week. In that time, I learned things about Karl in pieces. He had once had a wife and a son. Both were gone now, taken in a mutant raid years back. He spoke about it like he’d worn the grief down to a smooth stone—accepted, but never really put down.

He also mentioned, almost in passing, that he’d been SED-4—Special Extermination Division. One of the elite. The kind of people safe zones relied on when something truly monstrous crawled out of the wasteland. Suddenly, his watchful stillness, his efficiency, the pistol always within reach, all of it made more sense.

What didn’t make sense was why he was still out here. A man like that could have gotten a comfortable slot inside a safe zone—training recruits, guarding a council, something. Instead, he lived in a half-buried barn with a dog and a stove. I didn’t ask why. Not yet.

When the fever finally broke and I stopped waking up drenched in sweat, Karl decided I was ready for “lesson one.”

He woke me before dawn. The world outside the window was still blue and half-formed. My body protested as I dragged myself out of bed and pulled on the thickest clothes I had. The cold slapped me in the face when I stepped outside.

The yard was a patch of trampled snow ringed by sagging fence posts and the leaning bulk of the barn. Karl stood near a battered wooden table, arms crossed, breath puffing in the air. A pistol sat on the table beside a rusted tin can. Viggo sat at his heel, ears forward, watching me.

“First thing you’re learning,” Karl said, “ain’t shooting. Ain’t hunting.” His gaze sharpened. “It’s trust.”

“Trust?” I echoed, teeth already starting to chatter. “You mean like… teamwork?”

He snorted. “Teamwork’s a pretty word for people who’ve never been betrayed.” He jerked his chin toward the table. “Pick it up.”

My eyes flicked to the pistol. “I don’t even—”

“Pick. It. Up.”

I did. The metal was bitterly cold in my hand. It felt heavier than it looked.

“Now point it at me,” he said.

I stared at him. “What?”

“You heard me.”

Every instinct screamed that this was a bad idea. My hand started to tremble before I even raised the gun.

“Is this a joke?”

Karl didn’t move. “Lesson one, Alexander,” he said calmly. “Out here, trust’ll keep you alive longer than a bullet. But it can also get you killed faster. So tell me—do you trust me enough not to shoot you?”

Viggo whined quietly beside him, picking up the tension. My pulse thundered in my ears.

“You’re the one who saved me,” I said. “Of course I trust you.”

“Then lower it,” he said.

I did, carefully angling the barrel toward the snow.

He nodded once. “Good. That’s your first mistake.”

Before I could blink, he moved. His hand snapped out, twisting my wrist just enough to make the gun fall. In the same motion, he caught it and pressed the barrel gently against my chest. His face didn’t change. He wasn’t angry. Just making a point.

“Never say you trust someone,” he said. “Make ’em earn it. Every damn day.”

He stepped back, flipped the gun in his hand, and offered it to me grip-first.

“Lesson one complete.”

I took it, fingers stinging. My heart was still racing, but I understood. Out here, words were just air. Trust had to be proven, over and over, or it wasn’t worth betting your life on.

That night, after hours of drills that left my muscles shaking and my lungs burning, he sat me down by the stove and laid out the rest.

“For the next year,” Karl said, leaning forward in his chair, “you’re gonna learn three things.” He held up three thick fingers. “How to fight. How to hunt. And how to think. You can get by if you’re bad at one of ’em. Maybe two. Lose all three, and you’re already dead. Just waiting on something to notice.”

Viggo lay stretched out at his feet, tail thumping occasionally when Karl’s boot brushed his side. The fire snapped and spat in the stove, filling the silence between sentences.

“You’ll learn to track prey,” Karl continued, “and how to tell when *you’re* the prey. You’ll learn how to build traps, make fire without wasting fuel, skin something without ruining the meat. You’ll learn how to kill fast and clean when you have to. And you’ll learn to treat pain like rain—annoying, sometimes dangerous, but not a reason to stop moving.”

He turned his head, looking out the small window toward the white fields beyond. “Most important, you’ll learn to wait. Patience is what separates hunters from corpses. Out here, you’ll be both sooner or later. You just have to pick which one you are when it counts.”

He looked back at me. “You’re gonna hate me for a while,” he said. “You’ll curse me. Might even wish I’d left you in the snow. But if you’re still breathing after that year…” A faint, tired smirk tugged at his mouth. “…you’ll thank me.”

I didn’t believe him then. Not really. I nodded anyway.


The year that followed broke me and rebuilt me more times than I wanted to count.

Mornings started before dawn. Karl would shake me awake while the sky was still dark, shove a piece of bread into my hand, and have me out in the snow before my eyes were fully open. I learned to follow Viggo’s tracks through drifts and over ice, to recognize the difference between his gait and the prints of wild animals.

We ran strength drills until my lungs burned and my legs shook—hauling firewood, dragging sleds loaded with scrap, climbing the low hills beyond the barn over and over. When my arms screamed, he put a rifle in my hands and made me shoot until my aim stopped wobbling. When I failed, I repeated it. When I succeeded, I repeated it again until success felt boring.

He taught me how to read the land: how snow lay differently over buried debris; how broken branches or disturbed frost could mean something living had passed recently; which plants could be eaten and which would put me in the ground faster than any mutant.

I learned silence. I learned how to breathe so that the rise and fall of my chest didn’t shake the barrel of a gun. I learned how to lie still in the snow until numbness set in and wait for a target to make the first mistake.

And I learned, one small moment at a time, that trust really was something tested, not given.

Months bled into each other. The bruises changed, the scars accumulated, but somehow I kept waking up. Slowly, almost reluctantly, my body adapted. I stopped gasping halfway up the hill. My hands steadied. My shots landed closer to where I wanted them to.

Karl never once taught me how to fight another human. He never walked me through strategies for taking on mutants, either.

“You’re not a soldier,” he would say whenever I pushed. “You’re a survivor. You only fight if running’s worse.”

When it came to open combat, I was still useless. But I could hunt. I could track. I could keep my hands moving even when my fingers felt like ice. I could breathe through fear without freezing.

One afternoon deep into winter, I moved through the skeletal remains of what had once been a small town, snow crunching under my boots. A rifle hung from my shoulder. My breath came out in steady white puffs. To my left, in the treeline, a guttural sound echoed—somewhere between a grunt and a roar. A moose.

I slipped behind a half-crumbling wall, raised the rifle, and waited. Two slow breaths. Sight, line, squeeze. The crack of the shot rolled across the ruins. Then silence.

Viggo padded ahead, nose to the ground, leading me to where the animal had fallen. He wagged his tail once, sharply, as if to say *good enough.*

Dragging the moose back to the barn was its own special hell. Karl had helped me rig a sled out of old sheet metal and rope, but “help” ended there. The animal’s weight turned each meter into a minor war. My shoulders screamed. My legs burned. My fingers ached inside my gloves.

But the barn’s roof eventually appeared over the rise, a familiar, lopsided silhouette against the gray sky. Smoke curled from the chimney. Home, for a certain battered definition of the word.

“Karl!” I shouted, or tried to, as I trudged into the yard. “I’m back with the moose!”

Viggo bounded ahead, circling the carcass with all the pride of a co-hunter. He sniffed, snorted, then trotted toward the barn, barking once.

Karl stepped out from around the corner, wiping his hands on a rag. For the first time since I’d met him, he was… smiling. Not the faint smirk he reserved for dark jokes. A real, if slightly rusty, smile.

“You’ve caught yourself a big one, Colt,” he said. He clapped a hand on my back hard enough to jolt my teeth. “Get ’im hung up so we can skin it. I’ll prepare a moose roast.”

A roast. Not stew. The word alone felt like a celebration.

As I hauled the carcass toward the hooks in the barn, a knot of nervous curiosity twisted in my stomach. Karl had been acting a little different lately—quieter in a softer way, watching me with an expression I couldn’t quite parse.

It unsettled me. But I didn’t mind the idea of a special meal.


By the time evening rolled around, the smell drifting through the house was enough to make me dizzy. Karl had gone all out. I sat at the rough wooden table, fingers tapping restlessly against the surface, listening to the small clatter of dishes in the next room.

I was nervous. I didn’t know why. It felt like waiting for an exam you hadn’t studied for.

Karl came in carrying two plates. He set one in front of me and one at his place across the table. Thick slices of roasted moose lay under a glossy brown sauce, flanked by potatoes, carrots, and actual greens. Viggo sat hopefully at Karl’s side, eyes locked on the meat.

Karl tore off a piece and flicked it to the dog. “There you go, buddy,” he murmured, then looked up at me.

“What’s with all this?” I asked, trying—and failing—to sound casual. “Feels a little… extra, don’t you think?”

He let out a slow breath through his nose, like he’d been expecting the question.

“Colt,” he said, voice softer than I’d ever heard it, “this past year, you’ve filled a gap in my heart.” He held my gaze, the corner of his mouth lifting in that rare, real smile. “To me… you’re starting to look like my son.”

The words hit harder than any training blow.

For a moment, I forgot how to breathe. My throat tightened. My fingers clenched around the edge of the table.

“And I want to thank you for that,” he continued. “For reminding me that joy can still be found, even in a world like this.”

He straightened slightly, shoulders squaring the way they did when he was about to say something important. “Today marks one year since I pulled you out of the snow,” he said. “So tonight, I wanted to make it special. For you.”

The room was quiet except for the faint crackle of the fire and Viggo’s tail thumping softly against the floor. The plates in front of us steamed gently, a ridiculous luxury in a dead world.

I opened my mouth, searching for something clever, something grateful, something that matched the weight of what he’d just given me. All that came out was a hoarse, honest:

“Thank you.”

It didn’t feel like enough. But the look in Karl’s eyes said it was a start.

I picked up my fork, took a bite, and decided that if this was a story I was writing, this would be the end of the first chapter of my real life: not the moment I left the walls, but the moment I found a reason to keep going once I did.


I didn’t sleep much that night. Too full, too warm, too… seen.

Karl snored like an old generator on low power. Viggo, who had decided at some point that my doorway belonged to him, huffed and shifted every time the wind rattled the boards. I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling, replaying Karl’s words.

*You’re starting to look like my son.*

Nobody had ever said anything like that to me.

Nobody had ever really said much about me at all.

At some point, my thoughts blurred and I dropped into shallow, jittery sleep. When Karl shook my shoulder awake, it felt like I’d just blinked.

“Up,” he said. “We’re going out.”

I squinted at him. “Morning to you too.”

“Sun’s already working,” he replied. “Try and keep up.”

Outside, the cold bit harder than usual. The sky was a heavy, colorless smear, the kind that promised more snow but hadn’t committed yet. Karl handed me my rifle and slung a larger one over his shoulder. Viggo danced in dumb, excited circles, tongue lolling, like we were heading to a picnic instead of the ruins.

“Where are we going?” I asked, adjusting the strap.

“Town,” Karl said.

I stared past him, toward the broken shapes on the horizon. “That’s… specific.”

He gave me a look. “You wanted to see the world, didn’t you? Congratulations. Today you get the scenic tour of what’s left of a shopping district.”

“Wow,” I said. “Dreams really do come true.”

“Yeah. Try not to die in them.”

We started walking. Snow crunched under our boots. After a minute of silence, I cleared my throat.

“So,” I said, “is this like… a ‘you’ve survived a year, let’s go on a field trip’ thing, or a ‘we’re running out of canned beans’ thing?”

Karl shifted the weight of his pack. “Think of it as… curriculum expansion.”

“That sounds fake.”

“Everything out here sounds fake,” he said. “Doesn’t stop it from killing you.”

“Comforting pep talk,” I muttered.

He smirked, just a little. “You want comfort, you should’ve stayed behind the wall.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Because that was so comfortable.”

Karl glanced sideways at me. “You had four walls, electricity, and people who didn’t want to eat you.”

“I had mold, recycled air, and people who would’ve sold me for a fresh sandwich,” I shot back. “But thanks for the nostalgia trip.”

He snorted. “A fresh sandwich, huh?”

“You ever had safe-zone meat?” I asked. “They call it ‘protein product’ on the packaging. You bite into it and you know exactly why.”

“Out here, if it doesn’t bite back, it’s gourmet,” Karl said. “You’re getting picky.”

“I just think food shouldn’t squeak when you chew it,” I said.

Viggo barked once, as if voting in favor of any food.

“See?” Karl said. “Dog’s got better priorities than you.”

We walked in silence for a while after that, the sort of silence where both of us had more to say and neither of us chose to. The buildings grew larger and closer as we approached the outskirts of the dead town: concrete husks, glass long gone, metal bones rusting through.

When we reached the first collapsed storefront, Karl raised a hand and slowed down.

“Alright,” he said. “Lesson for today.”

“Another one?” I grumbled. “Didn’t we do twelve months of ‘lessons for today’ already?”

“This is graduation material,” he said. “Different subject.”

I lifted an eyebrow. “Which is?”

“People.”

I stopped. “I thought you said we avoid people.”

“We do,” Karl said. “But avoiding doesn’t mean pretending they don’t exist. So today, you’re learning how to walk through a place they *might* be without getting shot, stabbed, recruited, or robbed blind.”

“So… all the fun social options,” I said.

“Exactly,” he said. “Stay close. Mouth shut unless I ask. Eyes open all the time.”

“That’s a lot of conditions.”

“You can add ‘staying alive’ to the list if it helps.”

“Fair point.”

We passed under the twisted remains of a billboard frame. The half-rotten plastic still hanging from it showed three smiling people holding soda bottles, all teeth and perfect skin and mid-laugh. The slogan at the bottom read: TASTE THE FUTURE. Someone had spray-painted over it in red: WE DID.

I eyed it. “That aged well.”

Karl followed my gaze. “Future usually tastes worse than the ads.”

“Not sure the past did much better,” I said.

Karl made a noncommittal sound. “Past at least had the decency to stay where it belonged.”

We ducked into what used to be a pharmacy. The sign above the door had lost most of its letters, so it just read: HAR A Y. Inside, shelves lay tipped over like fallen dominoes. Old plastic bottles and paper boxes lay scattered everywhere, labels faded, contents probably lethal.

“Rule of thumb,” Karl said, stepping over a heap of crumbled packaging. “If you find pills, you don’t recognize them, and the bottle’s older than you are, you leave them the hell alone.”

“Even if it says ‘extra strength’?”

“Especially if it says ‘extra strength.’”

“What about these?” I picked up a white bottle so chipped it only read ‘-tal Vit–’. I unscrewed the cap and sniffed. It smelled like old paper and dust.

Karl took it from my hand. “Multivitamins. Might be worth grinding into food. Or might make you puke your lungs out. We’ll test it on Viggo.”

Viggo sneezed loudly, as if offended.

“I’m kidding,” Karl told the dog. Then, to me: “We’ll test it in small doses. On you.”

“Oh, good,” I said. “I always wanted to be a science experiment.”

“You already were,” Karl said. “You grew up behind the wall.”

“That’s… uncomfortably fair.”

We scavenged quietly for a while. Karl showed me what to look for: sealed packets that hadn’t bloated with moisture, glass bottles with unbroken caps, sterile bandages sealed in plastic.

At one point I picked up a little plastic bag of brightly-colored tablets shaped like stars.

“What about these?” I asked. “They look like candy.”

He glanced over. “They were candy.”

“So… gone bad?”

“Sugar doesn’t really go bad,” Karl said. “It just gives you a different set of problems.”

“My favorite kind,” I said, slipping the bag into my pocket.

Karl gave me a sideways glance. “You planning to open a black-market candy stall or what?”

“I was thinking ‘emergency morale ration,’ actually.”

He let it go.

We stepped back out into the street not long after, packs a little heavier. The wind moved through the empty windows with a low, hollow moan.

“Hey, Karl?” I said.

“Mm.”

“That thing you said last night,” I started, then stalled. My feet kept moving on autopilot.

“Gonna need you to narrow it down,” he said dryly. “I said a lot of things. None of ’em came with subtitles.”

“The, uh… ‘starting to look like my son’ thing,” I said.

Karl’s jaw tightened just a fraction. “What about it?”

“I just…” I searched for something smart, something meaningful. Came up empty. “…I’m not great at… that kind of stuff, but… I’m glad you didn’t leave me in the snow. That’s all.”

Karl walked in silence for a few steps. Then he said, “Yeah, well. I already told you the selfish reason. You filled a gap.”

“That doesn’t make it less important.”

“Didn’t say it did,” he said. “Just means you don’t gotta act like I did it out of pure charity. I’m not that holy.”

“So we saved each other,” I said. “Like a really depressing buddy comedy.”

“You talk this much when things get serious?” he asked.

“Yes,” I said immediately.

He huffed something that might have been a laugh. “At least you’re consistent.”

We turned down a narrower street, flanked by what had once been cafes and restaurants. Their chairs were still there, metal legs frozen mid-scrape, tables overturned, menus rotting inside plastic frames.

I stopped at one of the windows, peering in. The inside was a chaotic mess of broken glass and toppled furniture, sunlight slanting through the gaps.

“Ever eat at a place like that?” I asked.

Karl stepped up beside me, eyes scanning the street, not the building. “Once,” he said. “Before the walls.”

“What was it like?”

“Loud,” he said. “Too many people, not enough space.” He paused. “Good coffee, though.”

“Coffee,” I repeated, like it was a spell. “I’ve read about that. Bitter, right?”

“If you make it wrong,” he said.

“You ever think about it?” I asked. “Going back inside just for… stuff like that?”

He shook his head once. “No.”

“Not even for coffee?”

“Coffee doesn’t taste right if you buy it with someone else’s life,” he said.

I looked at him. “That’s… specific.”

He didn’t answer. That told me more than anything he could’ve said.

We were halfway down the block when Viggo froze. One paw in the air. Ears up. Tail stiff.

Karl’s voice dropped. “Stop.”

I stopped. My hand slid toward the rifle strap on instinct.

“What is it?” I whispered.

Karl didn’t answer right away. His eyes tracked something I couldn’t see yet, head cocked just slightly. Then he jerked his chin toward a half-collapsed storefront ahead, glass doors long shattered.

“Voices,” he said quietly. “Two. Maybe three.”

I held my breath, listening. At first there was only the wind, the hum in my own ears. Then, faintly:

“…told you this block was cleaned already—”

“—yeah? Tell that to my empty bag, smartass—”

Human. Casual. Too casual.

My stomach dropped. “Bandits?” I guessed.

“Scavs at best,” Karl said. “Bandits if their day got worse than yours.”

“Should we go around?” I asked.

“Maybe,” he said. “But they’re between us and the way we came, and I’m not walking you blind into a different problem behind us.”

“So what do we do?”

Karl’s mouth set in a line. “We introduce ourselves and pray they’re lazy, not hungry.”

“That’s a terrible plan.”

“That’s the only one we’ve got.”

He glanced at me. “Remember what I said. Mouth shut unless I ask. Let me talk first. You aim only if I say. You shoot only if someone shoots at you first or I tell you otherwise. Understand?”

My heart ratcheted up a notch. “Yeah,” I said. “Got it.”

“And if it all goes to hell,” he added, “you drop low and find cover. Don’t stand in the open like a hero. Heroes are just corpses with better PR.”

“Got it,” I said again, throat dry.

We advanced slowly. The voices got clearer.

“…I’m just saying, if you hadn’t wasted three rounds on that drone last week—”

“It was still blinking! Blinking means ‘thinking,’ ‘thinking’ means ‘maybe shoots us in the back later.’ I solved the blinking problem.”

“You solved the ammo problem instead.”

We reached the storefront. Karl stopped just to the side of the open frame and raised his voice, calm and even.

“Hands where I can see them,” he said. “Nobody has to get stupid today.”

The effect inside was immediate. Something clattered. Someone cursed.

“Who the—”

“Shut up, shut up—”

Karl stepped into the doorway, rifle in his hands but not quite aimed. I was right behind him, pulse hammering so hard I could feel it in my teeth.

Inside, two people straightened up from behind a long-dead counter. Both had guns. Both also had the universal *oh shit* look of people who hadn’t planned on company.

One was a woman in a patched coat, dark hair buzzed short on one side and hanging in her eyes on the other. She had a pistol, held in both hands but low.

The other was a lanky guy with a rifle and the posture of someone attached to bad decisions by habit. His curls were pulled back, his skin a few shades darker than mine, and when he muttered, I caught the faint roll of something that didn’t come from Berlin.

“Easy,” Karl said. “You point, I point. We stand here all day and nobody makes it home for dinner.”

The woman eyed us. “That your idea of a greeting?” she asked. “Real warm.”

“Last time I said ‘good morning’ to strangers they tried to take my dog,” Karl replied.

The man’s eyes flicked to Viggo. “Looks like a good dog,” he muttered.

Viggo growled softly. The man flinched.

“Great watchdog,” Karl said. “Terrible at sharing.”

The woman snorted despite herself. Some of the edge in her shoulders eased. “Alright, *opa*,” she said, the nickname landing somewhere between joke and warning. “What do you want?”

“Just passing through,” Karl said. “We take our junk, you take yours. No one leaves with new holes.”

“Tempting offer,” she said. “Problem is, you’re the ones standing in our doorway with the bigger guns. Little hard to feel like equal business partners.”

Karl shrugged. “World’s unfair. I didn’t invent it.”

The man lifted his rifle a little. “Maybe you invented getting robbed,” he said. “Old guy with gear, kid with city face. That’s a lot of supplies.”

I felt my cheeks burn. “City face?” I whispered.

Karl didn’t look back at me. “Don’t rise to it,” he said under his breath.

Then, louder: “You fire that thing in here, son, and you’ll hit more glass than meat. Your barrel’s shaking. You sure you want to bet your life on that aim?”

The guy’s arms were shaking. Tiny, but noticeable now that Karl had said it. His finger wasn’t fully on the trigger, just hovering.

“Easy, Rex,” the woman murmured.

Rex. It sounded more like a nickname than a real one. I found myself wondering what his mother had actually called him in whatever city used to be home.

Karl shifted his stance slightly, never fully taking his eyes off them. “Look,” he said, “you don’t want a shootout. I don’t want a shootout. I’ve got a kid here who’s just learned how to hit a moose that doesn’t move much. I don’t want his first human target to be some idiot with a twitchy rifle and a bad nickname.”

“I heard that,” Rex said.

“Good,” Karl said. “Means your ears work. Now tell your hands to follow.”

The woman smirked again, just a little. “You always talk this much?” she asked.

“Only when I’m trying not to kill anyone,” Karl replied.

There was a beat. Two. The wind pushed a loose shard of glass across the floor with a delicate scrape.

Finally, the woman lowered her pistol a little. Not all the way. Just enough that it wasn’t aimed at Karl’s face anymore.

“Alright,” she said. “We do it your way, *opa*. You head back out that door, take a left, we’ll pretend we never met. Sound fair?”

Karl’s eyes narrowed a fraction. “You got people on the left?”

She smiled without humor. “If we did, I wouldn’t tell you.”

“Fair enough,” he said. “But if anyone takes a shot at my back, I’m coming back in here first before I die. Just so we’re clear.”

“You threatening me?” she asked.

“I’m old,” Karl said. “I don’t waste time on threats. Just promises.”

They stared at each other for another long moment. My arms were starting to feel weird from how tight I was gripping my rifle.

Then she nodded. “Get out of my shop, promise man,” she said. “And take city face with you.”

Karl finally took a step back. “Come on,” he murmured to me. “Slow. No sudden dances.”

I backed out with him, every nerve buzzing, fully expecting a gunshot to crack the air at any second. It never came. We stepped back into the street, the ruined storefront swallowing the scavengers behind us.

We walked in silence for a good thirty seconds. Viggo trotted ahead like nothing had happened.

Then my legs went weak with delayed terror. “Holy shit,” I exhaled. “Holy *shit*.”

“Breathe,” Karl said. “You did fine.”

“I didn’t do anything.”

“That’s what fine looks like,” he said.

I glanced back at the building. “You think they’ll follow us?”

“If they’re smart, no,” Karl said. “If they’re stupid, we’ll hear them before it matters.”

“You seemed… calm,” I said. “Very… talky.”

“You know what people with guns like to do?” Karl asked.

“Shoot?”

“Talk,” he said. “They like to feel like they’re in control. Like they’re clever. You give them something to argue with, they forget the part where they could just pull the trigger.”

“That’s messed up,” I said.

“That’s people,” he replied.

We looped around the block, away from the scavengers’ building. As the tension slipped off my shoulders, the cold came back with a vengeance.

“Hey, Karl?” I said after a while.

“Mm.”

“You said I ‘just learned how to hit a moose that doesn’t move much,’” I said. “You know that’s slander, right? That moose was moving.”

“Barely.”

“It was breathing aggressively.”

He snorted. “You want a medal or a statue?”

“A statue would be nice,” I said. “Maybe on top of the wall. Me, heroic pose, moose at my feet.”

“I’d push it off,” Karl said.

We walked a few more steps.

“That guy called me ‘city face,’” I muttered. “What does that even mean?”

“You look like someone who still remembers what warm showers feel like,” Karl said. “People out here don’t trust that.”

“I don’t remember warm showers,” I said. “I remember lukewarm water for thirty seconds if the timing gods were merciful.”

“Out here, that’s still royalty,” he said. “Give it time. The wasteland will wipe the city off you.”

“Can’t wait,” I said. “Do I get a certificate when that happens?”

“Sure,” Karl said. “I’ll carve it into your gravestone.”

Viggo barked once, like he approved of the joke.

The rest of the run was uneventful, which was a relief I didn’t appreciate until we got back and my hands finally stopped shaking. We’d gathered a handful of things that might keep us alive a few weeks longer. Vitamins, maybe. Bandages, definitely. A couple of sealed tins, miraculously intact.

That night, as we sat by the stove with bowls of thick stew, the encounter sat between us like a third bowl no one was eating from.

“Those two,” I said eventually. “You think they’ll make it?”

Karl chewed, swallowed, took his time. “Maybe,” he said. “Long as they don’t try to be heroes either.”

“You were SED-4,” I said. “You’ve probably killed more people than I’ve spoken to. Today you just… walked away.”

He stared into the fire for a second. “I’ll kill when I have to,” he said. “Doesn’t mean I go looking for volunteers.”

“But if they’d shot first—”

“Then we’d be having a different conversation,” he said. “Or no conversation at all.”

I sat with that for a moment. “You ever regret it?” I asked. “The ones you did kill?”

He didn’t answer right away. The fire popped, sending up a brief spray of sparks.

“I remember them,” he said finally. “Regret’s a luxury. Remembering is a job.”

“That sounds like something someone wise would say,” I said.

“Yeah, well,” he muttered. “Don’t quote me.”

Too late. I already had.

Later, when I was alone in my room with my notebook open, I wrote it down anyway:

*Regret is a luxury. Remembering is a job.*

I didn’t know if it made me feel better or worse. But it felt like the kind of line that belonged in the story I was trying to write, the one where I was still alive long enough to tell it.

And for now, that was enough.


Next day slid into place like all the others: cold, white, and busy trying to kill us in small, creative ways.

We hunted. We checked the traps. We skimmed the tree line for tracks and trouble. Karl pointed out signs I would’ve missed a year ago—a broken twig here, a smear of fur on bark there. We hauled in a rabbit, some stringy-looking bird, and a sad armful of firewood that smoked more than it burned. Viggo was smug the whole time, like he was the real brains behind the operation. He probably was.

By evening, the routine had folded itself neatly back into the house. Fire in the stove. Shadows on the walls. Two bowls of stew on the table.

The only thing that felt different was the way Karl kept looking at me when he thought I wasn’t paying attention.

We ate in silence for a while. The good kind. Spoon, bowl, crackle of fire. Then he set his spoon down with a soft clink that sounded way too deliberate.

“So,” he said. “What’s the plan?”

I glanced up. “For what? The stew? I was thinking I finish this bowl and then aggressively consider seconds.”

“Cute,” he said. “I mean *you*, Colt. What’s your plan?”

I frowned, buying time with another bite. “You’re gonna have to narrow that down. Survival plan, dinner plan, five-year plan—”

“Don’t get clever on me,” Karl said. “It doesn’t suit you.”

“Ouch,” I said. “That’s hurtful.”

He just looked at me. The stoic, carved-out-of-oak expression was there as usual, but something sat behind it tonight. A weight. A question he’d already asked himself and not liked the answer to.

“You’ve got that notebook,” he said. “You’ve got a dream. You said so. So. What do you plan on doing with it?”

I stared into my bowl like it might rescue me. A chunk of meat floated up, unhelpful.

“I don’t…” I started, then stopped. “I don’t know yet.”

“Bullshit,” he said.

I blinked. “That’s rude.”

“It’s accurate,” Karl replied. He picked up his spoon again but didn’t eat, just stirred the stew in small, slow circles. “You’ve known since the day you packed that bag back at the wall. You just don’t like the answer.”

I shifted in my chair, irritation and guilt bumping shoulders. “Alright, since you’re apparently psychic, what’s my answer?”

“You want to keep walking,” he said simply. “Further out. New places. More ruins. Maybe find out if the ocean is still where they left it.”

The stupid part was: hearing him say it pissed me off because it was exactly right.

“You say that like it’s a crime,” I muttered.

“Did I say it was a crime?” Karl asked. “Did I pull a gun on you and shout ‘dreaming is illegal now, hands where I can see them’?”

“Not yet,” I said. “Day’s still young.”

He smirked, but it faded quick. His eyes dropped to his bowl, then back up to me.

“Listen,” he said. “You’ve been here a year. You know how to not die in the first ten minutes anymore. That’s more than most. Question is: you gonna stay here playing farmhand with an old man and his dog, or are you gonna do what you actually came out here to do?”

“That’s a hell of a way to phrase ‘do you like living here,’” I shot back.

He shrugged. “You like living here?”

I opened my mouth, then closed it again. Because the answer was *yes* and *no* at the same time and I hated both of them.

“I mean… yeah,” I said finally. “I’m not dead. That’s a big plus. I’ve got a bed. Actual meals. Sometimes they even have vegetables. And you’re…” I waved my spoon at him. “You’re not the worst.”

“Careful,” he said. “Getting sentimental.”

“Bite me,” I said.

Viggo thumped his tail once, like he was volunteering.

“But,” Karl said, and there it was—that little weight sliding back into his voice. “When you sit in that bed at night, staring at the ceiling, you thinking ‘damn, can’t wait to do the same loop again for the next forty years’? Or you thinking about the maps in your head?”

I laughed, but it came out thin. “You’ve been spying on my ceiling time, huh?”

“You’re loud in your own skull,” Karl said. “Radiates off you. Even the dog hears it.”

Viggo looked up at the sound of his name, then went back to pretending not to listen.

I pushed my bowl away a few inches, appetite knotting.

“So what?” I said. “You kicking me out now? ‘Thanks for dragging in moose and nearly dying a bunch, Colt, door’s that way’?”

“If I wanted you gone, you’d be gone,” Karl said. “This isn’t about me wanting you out. It’s about you being too damned polite to admit you want out.”

“Polite?” I repeated. “That’s a new accusation.”

“You think I don’t see it?” Karl went on, ignoring me. “You stay an extra beat by the door every time we come back. You look at the horizon like it personally owes you money. You write in that notebook like you’re late for your own story.”

He finally took another spoonful of stew, chewed, swallowed.

“And you look at me,” he added quietly, “like leaving would be… betrayal.”

I stared at him. The word hit harder than I wanted it to.

“Well, yeah,” I said. “Because it *would*.”

Karl snorted. “You dramatic bastard.”

“I’m serious,” I said. “You dragged me out of the snow. You patched me up. You taught me how to not freeze, starve, or get eaten by something with too many teeth. You call me your son over moose roast and then what, I just pack a bag and bounce? That doesn’t feel…” I groped for the word. “…right.”

“It’s not supposed to *feel* right,” he said. “Nothing does, out here. But it might be *true*.”

“That’s not comforting,” I said.

“Wasn’t trying to comfort you,” Karl replied. “I’m trying to stop you from lying to yourself until it eats you from the inside.”

We sat with that for a moment. The fire popped. Stew steamed. The silence got thick enough to chew.

“You know what happens to people who stay because they’re scared of hurting someone?” Karl asked suddenly.

“I’m guessing this is gonna be uplifting,” I said.

“They rot,” he said. “From the head down.”

He leaned back in his chair, eyes going somewhere that wasn’t the room.

“There was a guy in my old unit,” he said. “Before SED-4. Before the walls, even. Name was Kaden. Good shot. Bad decisions. He had a gang he ran with before he signed up—small-time turf boys, nothing impressive. We’re heading out of the city one day, orders in hand, and he gets this look. Like you, when you stare at the horizon. I know he wants to go. To see what’s past the checkpoints. To maybe not die in somebody else’s uniform.”

Karl’s fingers drummed once on the table.

“But he doesn’t,” he said. “He stays. ‘Can’t leave the boys,’ he says. ‘They need me,’ he says. They didn’t. Not the way he thought. Ten months later, half of them are dead and he’s one of ’em. Shot in a stairwell over a box of stolen meds. That’s what his loyalty bought him. A dirty floor and a lot of wasted potential.”

I swallowed. “You’re saying if I stay here, I’ll get shot in a stairwell?”

“I’m saying if you stay for *me,* you’re making the same category of mistake,” Karl said. “You don’t owe me your dream because I had a spare bed and a stew pot.”

“That’s easy for you to say,” I snapped. “You’re the one who stays. This is your… graveyard, or whatever.”

Karl actually smiled at that. Tired, but real.

“Yeah,” he said. “It is. I picked it. That’s the difference.”

I slumped back in my chair, frustration buzzing under my skin.

“So what do you want from me?” I asked. “You want me to just say ‘thanks for everything, old man, I’m gonna go die somewhere interesting now’? You want me to walk out tomorrow like this was a training camp and I just graduated?”

He held my gaze.

“I want you to answer one question honest,” he said. “Just one.”

“Fine,” I said. “Shoot.”

He pointed his spoon at me like a little ladle-gun.

“If it was just you,” he said. “No me. No Viggo. No barn. Just you and that bag and whatever’s left of your courage. What would you do?”

The answer was there immediately, like it had been sitting in my throat waiting for an excuse.

“I’d walk,” I said. “I’d… keep going. See what’s out there. See if there’s more than just different flavors of ruin. See if any of the stuff in those books wasn’t a total lie.”

“Then that’s your answer,” Karl said. “That’s the only one that counts.”

I looked down at my hands. They were scarred now. Callused. Not the soft, useless things I’d carried out of the safe zone.

“It still feels like I’d be… abandoning you,” I muttered.

Karl snorted again.

“I was alone before I met you, Colt,” he said. “I’ll be alone after you leave. That’s not new territory for me. You, on the other hand, were *born* inside walls. You going back into one, just because I might get a little quiet again? That’s the real abandonment. Of yourself.”

“That sounds like a line you want me to write down,” I said.

“Don’t you dare,” he said immediately. “You start quoting me in that notebook, I’m gonna start charging rent.”

I blew out a breath, half-laugh, half-sigh. The knot in my chest didn’t go away, but it shifted. Changed shape.

“How long were you sitting on this speech?” I asked.

“A while,” he admitted. “Figured I’d wait until you brought it up.”

“I didn’t bring it up,” I pointed out.

“You did,” he said. “You’ve been bringing it up with your eyes for months. Tonight I just decided to answer.”

I rubbed my face with both hands.

“So what,” I said through my fingers, “you want me to leave tomorrow?”

“I want you to leave when you’re ready,” Karl said. “But I also know you’re never gonna *feel* ready. So at some point, you just gotta pick a day and be wrong about it.”

I dropped my hands. The table between us suddenly felt… smaller. Closer.

“When did *you* pick your day?” I asked.

He considered that.

“When my wife and kid died,” he said, and there was no drama in it. Just fact. “World took the house. I decided it didn’t get to decide what I did next. So I walked until this place felt like enough. Now it is. For me. Doesn’t have to be for you.”

We let that hang there. There wasn’t anything I could put on top of it that wouldn’t sound pathetic by comparison.

“Okay,” I said finally. “Okay. Then… I guess I should pick a day.”

Karl nodded slowly. “Yeah. You should.”

“Tomorrow,” I heard myself say, before I could talk myself out of it. “If I wait longer, I’ll just… find excuses.”

His eyebrow twitched up. “Tomorrow,” he echoed. “Bold.”

“I may puke in the morning,” I said. “Just so you’re aware.”

“I’ve seen worse,” he said. “You puked the first time I made you gut a rabbit, remember?”

“Yeah, and you laughed for like fifteen minutes.”

“Correction,” Karl said. “The dog laughed. I was respectful.”

Viggo thumped his tail again, traitorously.

I pushed my bowl back and stood, legs a little unsteady.

“I’ll, uh… start packing,” I said.

“You still have a bag?” Karl asked. “Thought it finally died of old age.”

“It’s more patch than bag, but yeah,” I said. “Fitting, really.”

He grunted, then stood as well.

“Finish eating first,” he said. “Last thing I need is you face-planting on day one ’cause you got dramatic and skipped dinner.”

I sat back down automatically. Muscle memory. We finished the stew in mostly silence, but it wasn’t the heavy kind anymore. It was… loaded. Waiting.

After, I went to my room and opened the old bag on the bed. The canvas was worn, straps triple-stitched in places. It smelled like smoke, leather, and a year’s worth of mistakes.

I packed slower this time. Not panic-fast like the day I’d left the safe zone, but deliberate. Clothes, wrapped tight. Knife Karl had made me practice sharpening until my fingers blistered. Flint kit. Rope. The little plastic bag of star-shaped candy. The notebook, of course. The pen. A few pages of rough, hand-sketched maps Karl had drawn on scavenged paper.

I was staring at the last item—a folded scrap of cloth I didn’t actually remember owning—when a soft knock hit the doorframe.

“You decent?” Karl asked, already halfway in.

“Sadly,” I said. “What’s up?”

He stepped inside, something small glinting in his hand.

“Couple of parting gifts,” he said, like he was talking about leftovers.

He set them on the bed: a compact, well-oiled pistol in a worn holster, and a dented metal compass with the glass scratched to hell.

I stared. “Karl, I can’t—”

“You can,” he said. “And you will. You’re decent with a rifle, but out there you’ll need something smaller for surprises. And that compass—” he tapped it with a knuckle “—saved my ass more times than I care to admit.”

I picked it up. The needle trembled, then settled, stubbornly pointing north like it still believed in the concept.

“You sure you don’t need it?” I asked.

He snorted. “I know where my grave is. Don’t need a compass to find it.”

“That’s dark,” I said.

“World’s dark,” he replied. “You’re just used to the curtains.”

I swallowed around the lump in my throat.

“Thanks,” I said. “For… you know. All of it.”

“I know,” he said. “You’re not as mysterious as you think.”

We stood there in the awkward almost-silence of two people who had run out of useful words.

“You know you can come back, right?” Karl said finally. “Any time. Door’s not locked. You get out there, find out the world’s even dumber than I told you, you haul your sorry ass back here. We’ll find you a new moose to fight.”

I let out a shaky laugh. “You saying I can do another year of boot camp if I miss being yelled at?”

“Another year, two,” he said with a shrug. “Until I croak. Or you get sick of my cooking. Whichever comes first.”

“I’m already sick of your cooking,” I said automatically.

“Liar,” he said.

We looked at each other a long moment. I didn’t hug him. He didn’t open his arms. It wasn’t that kind of thing. But something settled between us anyway. An understanding. A line that wasn’t a wall.


The next morning, the sky was a flat gray bruise. I stood at the edge of the yard with the bag on my shoulder, the pistol snug at my side, the compass in my pocket ticking quietly against my leg like a second heartbeat.

Karl stood by the fence, one hand on a post, the other scratching Viggo’s neck. The dog whined, clearly offended by this whole development.

“You’re not taking him,” Karl said, before I could even start to ask.

“I didn’t say anything,” I protested.

“You *thought* it,” he said. “He’s useful. You’re still optional.”

“Rude,” I said. “I thought I was family.”

“Family visits,” Karl said. “Doesn’t steal the dog.”

I grinned despite the cold gnawing at my insides.

“Alright,” I said. I looked out at the white fields, the broken lines of distant buildings, the thin black veins of roads leading nowhere good. “Guess this is it.”

“For now,” Karl said.

“For now,” I echoed.

He pushed off the post and stepped closer, squinting at me like he was checking for loose screws.

“Repeat it back,” he said.

“What, the survival rules?” I asked.

“All of it,” he said. “Humor an old man.”

I rolled my eyes, but started ticking them off on my fingers.

“Don’t trust anyone who smiles too fast,” I said. “Don’t eat bright mushrooms, even if they look friendly. Fire buys you time but costs you stealth. If something looks abandoned *and* convenient, it’s neither. If you hear humming and you don’t know where it’s coming from, leave.”

“Good,” he said. “What else?”

“If you have to choose between running and fighting—”

“Run,” we said together.

He nodded once.

“And if you find someplace better than this,” he added, “you stay.”

I hesitated. “Even if that means I never come back?”

Karl’s mouth twitched.

“I’m not in charge of your ending, Colt,” he said. “Never was. I just got to write a chapter.”

I looked at him properly then. The lines in his face, the gray in his beard, the steady way he stood even with all that history hanging off his shoulders like invisible armor.

“You’re in the acknowledgments, at least,” I said.

“What the hell is an acknowledgment?” he asked.

“It’s the part at the front where the idiot who wrote the book thanks the people who kept him from dying,” I said.

Karl snorted. “Make it short. Paper’s rare.”

I laughed, because the alternative was something messy.

Viggo stepped forward and shoved his head against my hand. I crouched, fingers digging into his fur.

“Take care of him,” I told the dog.

Viggo huffed, like *obviously.*

I stood, adjusted the bag on my shoulder, and took a step forward. Then another. The barn, the fence, Karl and Viggo—all of it shifted in my peripheral vision, moving from *here* to *behind.*

“Alexander,” Karl called.

I turned.

He didn’t move closer. Just raised a hand in a half-salute.

“You’re not livestock anymore,” he said. “Don’t start acting like it again. Got it?”

The words hit something deep and old in me. The walls. The numbers. The feeling of being counted instead of seen.

“Got it,” I said.

Then I turned back toward the ruins.

I walked.

The cold met me like an old enemy. The wind tugged at my coat. The world ahead was wide and broken and waiting.

For the first time since I’d left the Berlin Safe Zone, I wasn’t walking away from something.

I was walking *toward* it.


Traveling was quite the struggle at times. The kind that didn’t show up in stories.

You read about wandering the wastes and it sounds… clean. Long roads. Big skies. Maybe a dramatic storm if the author’s feeling generous.

Reality was different.

You had to keep moving, but never in straight lines. You had to look for food, but never stare too long at anything that might be watching you back. You had to sleep, but never deeply. Every choice was a trade: warmth or concealment, speed or safety, hunger or exposure.

In the beginning, it was a problem. A big one.

I got lost in places that didn’t even have names anymore. I misjudged distances, misjudged weather, misjudged my own limits. I almost froze once because I pushed an hour too long before making camp. I almost starved because I didn’t dare light a fire near a town I didn’t know.

Three months in, the problems were still there. I’d just gotten better at bleeding slower.

No violent encounters with humans. That still felt like luck more than skill. I’d seen shapes at a distance: a group moving along an old rail line, a handcart pushed over cracked asphalt, a flicker of light in a tower one night far off to the west. I always turned away. I didn’t wave. I didn’t call out.

I still hadn’t met a single mutant.

Part of me was relieved. The other part was confused.

Mutants were the reason the walls existed. The reason SED-4 had jobs. The reason kids in Berlin grew up looking at posters of twisted silhouettes ripping people apart in red ink.

Out here, it was just… quiet.

*How did they even manage to become such a threat,* I kept catching myself thinking, *when there’s barely any of them here?*

Maybe I was just walking through the spaces between disasters.

Another week passed. Or I think it did. Days blurred together when all you did was walk and endure.

I crested a low hill one afternoon and stopped dead.

Smoke.

Not a thin, wandering line from some lone traveler’s fire. A thicker column, rising steady. Dark at the base, grey at the top. Controlled.

My stomach tightened before my brain finished the thought.

I dropped into a crouch on instinct and stayed there, breathing shallow, watching. The wind cut across the hill and brought scents with it: burned wood, cooked food, a faint, oily trace of fuel. Human smells. More than one person. More than a couple.

I waited.

Thirty seconds. A minute. Nothing moved in the valley itself. Just that steady climb of smoke.

Slowly, I slipped my bag off one shoulder and pulled my binoculars out with numb fingers. The metal bit at my skin. I pressed the lenses to my eyes and inched forward until the valley opened up beneath me.

It wasn’t a town. Not really.

Someone had carved a perimeter into the ruins. A ring of rough wooden walls—logs where they’d had trees, scavenged beams everywhere else—all sharpened to points at the top. Watch platforms broke the line at intervals. On each platform: a figure, a rifle, a silhouette used to standing still. Inside, containers and makeshift shacks clustered tight into the shells of old buildings. Tarps stretched between them like low, tired clouds.

Fires burned behind the walls. Two, maybe three. Light flickered under the tarps, orange and dirty.

Minor safe zone. Fortified camp. Gang stronghold. The label didn’t matter. It was a place built specifically to keep people like me *out.*

The safe choice was obvious: turn away while they still didn’t care who I was. Follow the ridge until the camp was just another circle in my head: *don’t go here*.

I stayed where I was.

I thought about the last weeks of sleep. Half-sleeps, really. Curled in the back of dead cars. Wedged into collapsed stairwells. Always waking to every noise. Always wondering if I’d just slept through the last sound I’d ever hear.

I thought about heat that didn’t come from a nervous little fire I was terrified someone else would see.

*You should leave,* something in me said. *You know better than this.*

I knew Karl would have turned away. Or at least, he would have decided faster.

I lowered the binoculars. My hands were shaking.

I could walk. I could turn north or south, put days between me and this place, pretend I’d never seen it.

Instead, I slid the binoculars back into my bag, tightened the strap on my shoulder, took a breath that didn’t feel deep enough, and started down the hill.

Every step toward the valley floor felt exposed. My boots pressed into snow and brittle grass; the sound was too loud in the open air. No broken car bodies to hide behind. No trees thick enough to disappear into. Just me, the wind, and a line of walls full of strangers who had built their lives around *not* trusting voices from outside.

By the time I reached flatter ground, I knew they’d seen me. You didn’t build watch platforms that high and miss an idiot walking straight toward you.

I kept going until something in me locked and refused to take another step without permission.

“STEHEN BLEIBEN!”

The shout cracked across the valley from one of the platforms near what had to be the front gate. A heartbeat later, the same voice, rough German wrapped around careful English:

“Stop right there! Don’t move!”

My body obeyed before my thoughts did. I stopped dead.

“Hände hoch! Hands up! Over your head, jetzt!”

I raised my hands slowly. The bag strap dug into my shoulder. My fingers spread automatically, palms open.

Metal clicked above me. Rifles shifting, safeties, bolts. I couldn’t see them properly from this angle, but I *felt* them—thin, invisible lines running from the wall straight through my chest.

“Don’t move!” another voice called from closer in, ground level this time. “Nicht bewegen! Stay where you are!”

“I’m not moving!” I called back. My voice sounded smaller than I wanted in the cold air.

“Louder!” the first voice barked.

“I’m not moving!” I repeated, forcing my lungs to work. “Hands are up!”

There was a low burst of conversation above the gate, too fast and too soft for me to catch anything but rhythm.

Then the main doors—two big slabs of welded metal from three different lifetimes—shifted, scraped, and groaned open just enough for two people to step through.

They walked out with the controlled kind of confidence that said they’d survived too many bad days already.

Both were layered in winter gear and scavenged armor: padded jackets with plates bolted on, reinforced shoulders, thick gloves, scarves around their lower faces. Goggles hung at their necks. The colors were all the same ruined grey by now, dust and smoke ground into every seam.

The one on the left was a woman. Late thirties, maybe. Light brown skin, dark hair hidden under a cap, lines at the corners of her eyes that looked more like habit than age. She held a carbine at a low ready—barrel not quite on me, not quite away.

The other was a man with a close-cut beard and a shotgun in both hands. He stayed half a step behind her, slightly to the side, covering the space I occupied without needing to look at it.

They stopped about ten, twelve meters out.

“Stay exactly where you are,” the woman said. Her English was clear, careful. “Do not step forward. Do not step back. Verstanden? You understand?”

“Yes,” I said. “I understand.”

Her eyes moved over me: coat, bag, boots, the rifle strapped across my back. She lingered on Karl’s pistol at my side.

“Name,” she said.

“Alexander Colt,” I answered. My mouth felt dry.

“Where from, Alexander Colt?” she asked.

“Berlin Safe Zone,” I said. “Originally.”

Something shifted in her face. Recognition, but no surprise.

The man gave a short, quiet comment in German, aimed at her, not at me.

She didn’t answer him. Her attention stayed on me.

“You walked,” she said. It wasn’t really a question. “Or they put you out?”

“I walked,” I said.

It felt strange, saying it out here. Behind the walls, leaving had been an idea. Out here, it sounded more like a confession.

“Why?” she asked.

A hundred reasons pushed at my throat. The walls. The numbers. The air that never changed. The way the stories I read never lined up with the days I woke into.

None of that belonged here. Not with rifles on me.

“I wanted out,” I said finally. “I wanted to see what was outside.”

Her eyes narrowed just a fraction.

“Are you infected?” she asked. The word hit in the same place it always had back in Berlin—sirens and posters and drills. “Any Fieber, that does not go away? Skin lesions. Tremors. Schwarze Linien an den Adern—black lines on the veins. Augen, that look… cloudy.” She watched my face as she listed them. “Anything like this?”

“No,” I said immediately. Then forced myself to add, “Not that I know of.”

“Have you been around anyone with those symptoms?” she pressed. “Close. Same room, same air.”

“No,” I said. “I’ve barely been around anyone at all.”

The man spoke for the first time directly to me, voice rough but controlled.

“Bites?” he asked. “Bisse? Deep cuts from things you did not see clearly. Wounds that smell wrong. Flesh that would not close.”

I shook my head once, careful not to move anything else.

“No,” I said. “Just falls. Scrapes. I cleaned them. They healed.”

The woman gave a small nod without looking away from me.

“Elias,” she said, still in German, but slow enough that even I caught the meaning. “Check him.”

He started toward me. The shotgun stayed in his hands, angled low but ready. Each step was deliberate, measured, like he’d done this too many times to hurry now.

“Keep your hands up,” he said. “Wenn sie runtergehen, I pull the trigger. Don’t test it.”

“I won’t,” I said.

He circled me once, keeping just out of arm’s reach. His gaze moved over clothing and seams, searching for shapes that didn’t belong.

“Roll your sleeves,” he said. “Ärmel hoch. One arm at a time. Slow.”

I unclasped one hand from the other, feeling the tremor in my fingers, and pinched the cuff of my sleeve. I rolled it up to my elbow. The air bit at the bare skin. Old scrapes from training. A few pale scars. Nothing else.

“Other arm,” he said.

I repeated the motion. My hands felt clumsy. The cold and the adrenaline were starting to blur together.

He stepped closer, eyes running along the veins under my skin, the backs of my hands, the tendons. After a second, his gloved hand came up, fingers catching my chin and turning my head toward him.

“Look at me,” he said. “Schauen Sie mich an.”

I did. His eyes were dark, ringed with tiredness, but sharp. He studied my pupils, the whites, the way I tracked his face.

Then he let go and stepped back.

“Nichts Auffälliges,” he said to the woman. Nothing obvious. “If he’s carrying something, it’s not on the surface.”

“Very good,” she murmured, dry. Then: “Thank you.”

She adjusted her grip on the carbine. The barrel dropped a few degrees. Not much. Just enough to let my lungs work again.

“What do you want from Rustfield, Alexander Colt from Berlin?” she asked. The name settled over the place like it had always been there.

“Somewhere to sleep,” I said. I heard the strain in my own voice. “Under a roof. A chance to rest. Maybe… get my bearings. I don’t know this area. I’ve just been walking.”

“Trade?” she asked. “What do you offer außer einem extra Magen? Besides another stomach?”

“I can work,” I said quickly. Too quickly. I forced myself to slow down. “Hunting. Guard shifts. Scavenging. I was trained to survive outside the walls. I can track, shoot, move quietly. I don’t have much in my pack, but I can earn my place.”

She watched me in silence for a long breath. The camp behind her went on moving—distant voices, the dull ring of metal—but all of that felt far away.

“Hands down,” she said at last. “Slow.”

I let my arms come down, feeling the hot rush of blood back into numb muscles.

“Unsling the rifle,” she went on. “Gewehr ab. Put it on the ground. Muzzle away from us. Then the pistol. Same. Two steps back. You try anything else, you die here. Klar?”

“Yes,” I said quietly. “Clear.”

I moved as carefully as I knew how. The rifle strap slid off my shoulder. I crouched enough to set it on the ground, barrel pointing away. Then I unhooked Karl’s pistol from its holster and placed it beside the rifle.

I stepped back twice.

Elias moved in, eyes never leaving me, and picked up the weapons. He checked the rifle’s chamber, then the pistol’s, hands efficient and practiced. Satisfied, he slung the rifle across his back and tucked the pistol into his belt.

“These stay with us,” the woman said. “Bis Sie gehen. Until you leave. Or until we are sure you are not a problem.” Her gaze held mine. “You walk out calm, you get them back at the gate. You cause trouble, you don’t see them again. Understand?”

“Yes,” I said.

She looked up toward the wall.

“Tor auf!” she called.

The doors groaned wider, just enough for one person at a time.

Her attention snapped back to me.

“You step inside, you follow our rules,” she said. “No arguing at the gate. You do not draw steel or metal in these walls unless jemand mit Befugnis—someone with authority—tells you. You stay away from anything marked with hazard sign or the words *Abschirmung* or *Reaktor.*”

Her voice never rose, but I could feel every word.

“You do not fire a weapon inside Rustfield,” she went on, “unless etwas versucht schon, Sie zu töten—something is already trying to kill you. And if that happens, you had better be right about what it is.”

“We clear?” she finished.

“Yes,” I said. “We’re clear.”

“And if we tell you to leave,” she added, “you leave. No shouting. Kein Betteln. No begging. You walk the same way you came. That is how you live long enough to decide if you hate this place on your own.”

I nodded. My neck felt stiff.

“Elias,” she said. “Quarantine. Full night.”

“Ja,” he answered.

He jerked his head toward the open gate.

“Move,” he said to me. “Langsam. Don’t run. Don’t stop unless I say.”

I adjusted the strap of my bag and walked.

Crossing the line of the gate felt wrong in a way I couldn’t name. Not like Berlin—the walls there were higher, heavier—but the air changed anyway. Outside, sound had been thin and open. Inside, everything folded in on itself.

Voices. Different pitches layered over each other. Metal on metal. The thud of wood. Someone coughing, hard and wet, from somewhere deeper in. A child crying once, then choked off fast.

Rustfield was tighter than it had looked from the hill.

Containers were stacked two, three high, making narrow lanes and dead-ends. Old building fronts had been patched with whatever could be found—corrugated metal, cracked plastic, doors taken from somewhere else. Tarps sagged between them, heavy with soot, turning daylight into a dim, smoky half-light.

Fires burned in chopped-down barrels. People warmed their hands over them, glancing up as we passed. Some stared, assessing. Some looked away as soon as my eyes met theirs. I caught pieces of words from clusters—hard consonants, soft vowels, familiar curses. Faces in every shade winter would allow.

“Augen nach vorne,” Elias said under his breath. “Eyes front. Don’t stare. People think you weigh them up, they… lösen das Problem früh. They solve the problem early.”

“I’m not looking for trouble,” I said quietly.

“Nobody does,” he replied. “Kommt trotzdem.”

He led me along a narrower passage toward the outer edge of the camp. There, a secondary fence cut off a small section from the rest. A low building squatted inside it, built from overlapping scrap. Above the door, someone had painted a symbol in thick black strokes: a rough circle with a line slashed through it.

I didn’t know the design. I didn’t need to. The meaning was obvious enough.

Elias opened the door. The hinges complained.

“Hier bleibst du heute Nacht,” he said. “You stay here tonight. We bring water, food. Du kommst nicht raus—you do not come out—unless someone with red band on the arm tells you. You don’t open window. Don’t shout. Don’t bang on walls. There is a blanket and a bucket. That’s it.”

“And if… something shows up?” I asked. My voice sounded too quiet in the doorway. “Symptoms. Anything.”

He watched me for a couple of seconds, eyes unreadable.

“Dann ist hier Schluss für dich,” he said. “Then this is the end for you. And we make sure it does not go further than you.”

My chest felt like someone had put a hand on it and started to push.

“Understood,” I said.

I stepped inside.

The room was small. One narrow cot bolted to the wall. One crate that could pretend to be a table. The bucket in the corner. The air smelled like metal, old disinfectant, sweat that had tried to go somewhere else and failed.

Elias set a dented tin cup on the crate.

“Water,” he said. “From inside. Cleaner than what you had.”

“Thank you,” I managed.

He stood in the doorway a moment longer.

“Try to sleep,” he said. “Versuch zu schlafen. You fall over tomorrow in the middle of camp, nobody is impressed.”

He stepped back and pulled the door shut. The latch clicked. A lock turned.

The sounds of Rustfield dulled but didn’t disappear. Footsteps outside. A voice somewhere laughing once, then cutting off. Distant hammering.

I sat down on the cot. The mattress was thin but still softer than concrete or frozen dirt. I wrapped both hands around the tin cup. The water inside trembled slightly from the shaking in my fingers.

*You walked into this,* I told myself. *You chose it.*

That didn’t make my heart slow down.

I took a sip. It tasted like metal and something faintly chemical, but it was cold and it was clean.

For the first time since leaving Karl’s place, I was inside walls again. Different walls. Different rules. Same question humming at the back of my skull.

***What now?***


The question bounced around my skull for a while without finding anything to stick to.

A few minutes ago I’d had rifles pointed at my head. Now I was sitting on a flimsy cot in a box with a lock on the outside, holding a cup of clean water. My body hadn’t caught up yet. Everything inside me was still braced for impact.

I set the cup down on the crate and lay back on the mattress. It complained under my weight. The ceiling was just patched metal and wood, seams running in crooked lines.

*You wanted a roof,* I reminded myself. *Here it is.*

The urge to start planning clawed at me—routes, exits, what to do if they decided I was more trouble than I was worth. Karl’s voice muttered in the back of my head about always knowing where the door was.

But the exhaustion under all of that was heavier. Months of half-sleep. Weeks of flinching at every sound. The last few hours of walking straight into guns on purpose.

If they were going to kill me, they’d had easier moments.

I let my eyes close.

*Think tomorrow,* I told myself. *For once in your life, just… sleep first.*

Somewhere between one breath and the next, the tension unwound just enough for me to drop.


The knock woke me. Three short raps on metal, close enough that it felt like someone tapping directly on my skull.

I blinked up at the ceiling, disoriented for a second. Rustfield. Quarantine room. Not snow. Not Karl’s barn. The air smelled like old disinfectant and tin.

“Essen.” Food.

The voice was muffled through the door. Male. Young, maybe. I pushed myself upright, muscles creaking.

“Yeah,” I croaked. “I’m awake.”

A little hatch low in the door scraped open. A tray slid through: a dented metal bowl full of something steaming, a chunk of bread, another cup of water.

“Step back,” the voice said. “Zwei Schritte. Two steps.”

I did, holding my hands where he could see them. The tray came all the way in, then the hatch slammed shut again.

“Thank you,” I said.

There was a pause. Then: “Gern.” You’re welcome.

Footsteps stayed close instead of walking away. A moment later the main lock clicked. The door opened just a hand’s width, chain still on. A face appeared in the gap—late twenties, maybe, pale skin gone winter-dull, dark hair shaved short on the sides. There was a strip of faded red cloth tied around his upper arm.

“Just checking you are… alive,” he said. His English was slower than Mira’s, but careful. “No… how you say… *Anfall*?”

“Seizure,” I said. “No. No seizures. Just tired.”

He nodded, apparently satisfied he’d found the word he needed.

“You eat,” he said. “Then sleep again. Morgen früh, we see.” Tomorrow morning, we’ll see.

He started to close the door, hesitated.

“You are… American, ja?” he added, squinting at me a little like my face needed subtitles.

“Yeah,” I said. “Caught that, huh?”

He snorted. “Accent,” he said, as if that explained an entire continent. “Also the name.” He said it like *E-lek-sender.* “Alexander Colt. Very… film name.”

“Blame my parents,” I said. “What’s yours?”

He hesitated again, then shrugged, like it cost him nothing.

“Jonas,” he said. “Jonas Krämer. Wache.” Guard.

“Nice to meet you, Jonas,” I said. “Under the… circumstances.”

His mouth twitched once, almost a smile.

“Try to sleep,” he repeated. “First days here, you will not get much Ruhe.”

“Why not?” I asked before my brain could remind my mouth that questions were usually a luxury.

He lifted his shoulders.

“Arbeit,” he said simply. Work. “Everyone works. You too. Sonst…” He cut the word off. Otherwise.

I got the point.

“I can work,” I said. “Hunting, mostly.”

“Jäger?” He raised an eyebrow, more interested now. Hunter. “Gut. There is always Bedarf.” Always a need.

He let the door swing shut the rest of the way.

“Guten Appetit,” he added through the metal, and the lock slid home again.

The stew was thin by Karl’s standards, but after months on the road it tasted like a feast. Potatoes, something that might have been lentils, shreds of meat that had at least seen an animal once in their lives. Salt. Heat. I soaked it all up with the bread, wiped the bowl clean, and leaned back on the cot.

The exhaustion rolled in again, heavier this time now that my stomach had stopped complaining.

I thought about trying to write. My notebook was still in my bag, sitting against the wall where I’d dropped it. But the idea of standing up, of digging for the pen, felt like too much.

*Tomorrow,* I told myself again.

I lay down, pulled the thin blanket over myself, and let the sounds of Rustfield fade into a dull murmur.

Sleep came faster this time.


Morning arrived as a smear of grey light around the edges of the boarded-up window. My mouth tasted like metal and old dreams. My back ached in a familiar way—proof I’d actually slept long enough for it to complain.

The door opened without knocking this time. I jerked upright, heart spiking, before my brain caught up.

The woman from the gate stood in the doorway. The red armband sat on her upper arm now too. Elias was behind her, filling the frame.

“Guten Morgen,” she said. Then, in English: “Good morning.”

“Morning,” I replied, scrubbing a hand over my face. “Guess I didn’t die in the night.”

“That is a good start,” she said dryly. “Stand up, please.”

I swung my legs over the side of the cot and got to my feet. They held. That felt like another good sign.

She stepped inside, eyes scanning me the way they had out at the gate. Not suspicious exactly. Just… measuring.

“No fever?” she asked. “No strange Schmerzen? Pain? Head, chest, joints?”

“Just the usual ‘I’ve been sleeping on something that hates me’ pain,” I said. “Nothing new.”

She glanced at Elias. He gave the smallest nod.

“Gut,” she said. “Then we assume you are not a walking disaster. Yet.”

“That’s… reassuring,” I said.

“I am not here to reassure you,” she replied. Then she stuck out a hand. “Mira Hartmann. I run the Wache and Außenposten. Guards and outposts.”

Her grip was firm, warm despite the cold.

“Alexander Colt,” I said again, though she already knew. “But you know that.”

“Ja,” she said. “But here we do names properly. Sonst gibt es Chaos.” Otherwise there is chaos.

Elias stepped in behind her.

“You eat?” he asked. “Last night?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Stew. Bread. Didn’t leave a trace.”

“Gut,” he said. “You will need it.”

“Why?” I asked, even though I already knew the answer.

Mira answered for him.

“Because you start paying rent today,” she said. “You hunt, like you said.”

“Already?” I asked. “Don’t I get a tour first? Maybe a welcome basket?”

Elias snorted. Mira’s mouth twitched.

“This *is* the welcome,” she said. “You want a bed that is not quarantäne and a roof that does not leak onto your face, you work. Hunting is… simple. Clear. Low politics. Good for first day.”

Simple. Sure.

“What’s the job?” I asked. “Exactly.”

“You go raus with one of ours,” she said. “Bring back meat. Reh, if you can find. Deer. Not too far. Not too loud.” Her gaze sharpened. “You said you can track, you can shoot. Ja?”

“Yes,” I said. “I can.”

“You prove it,” she said. “Do well, you get a room. Warm. In a Haus, not a box.”

I tried not to show how much that offer hit me.

A room. Not just a cot and a bucket. A door that wasn’t a quarantine lock.

“Okay,” I said. “When do we leave?”

Elias checked the small watch on his wrist.

“Ten minutes,” he said. “Zieh dich warm an. Dress warm.”


They gave me my rifle back at the gate, just long enough to check the action before handing it over. The familiarity of its weight settled my nerves more than I wanted to admit. Karl’s pistol stayed with Elias—“later,” Mira had said, and that was that.

My “partner” for the hunt turned out to be a broad-shouldered man in his forties with windburnt cheeks and a beard shot through with early grey. His jacket looked older than I was. A faded patch on the sleeve showed a tiny tricolor flag—green, white, red.

“Italian?” I guessed, before I could stop myself.

He gave me a quick side-eye, amused.

“Half,” he said. “Meine Mutter ist aus Napoli. Father from Leipzig. So you get this.” He gestured at himself. “Mixed package.”

He stuck out a gloved hand.

“Enzo Ricci,” he said. “Most people say Enzo, because they are faul.” Lazy.

I shook his hand.

“Alexander,” I said. “Or Colt. People seem to like the last name more.”

“Colt,” he repeated, grinning briefly. “Very *western*.” He mimed twirling a revolver. “You ride horse too?”

“Not unless it wants to die,” I said.

He laughed once, a low, approving sound.

“Gut,” he said. “You have jokes. Jokes mean you are not already tot. Let’s see if we keep it that way, ja?”

We passed through the gate together, out into the open again. The air outside felt colder after the brief press of Rustfield. The sky was a dull, uniform grey. Snow lay in patchy sheets over broken asphalt and dead grass.

“Stay on my left,” Enzo said. “You see something, you whisper, you do not shout. You shoot only when you are sicher. If you hit nothing, you waste bullet. If you hit wrong thing, we run very fast.”

“Wrong thing like… mutant?” I asked.

He shrugged one shoulder.

“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe hungry man. Maybe some altes, dummes Kriegsspielzeug—old, stupid war toy—that wakes up if we are loud. Whatever it is, we don’t poke it, hm?”

“Sounds like a solid policy,” I said.

We walked in silence for a while after that. Enzo moved with the kind of easy, quiet confidence that said he’d been doing this long before Rustfield existed. His boots found paths through rubble I wouldn’t have seen. He avoided open lines without making it look like we were sneaking.

Twice, he lifted a hand and we stopped dead. Once for a distant shape that turned out to be just a collapsed billboard. Once for a scatter of fresh tracks in the snow.

“Reh,” he said, crouching to touch the prints with his fingertips. “Small. Two, maybe three. Not mehr als ein paar Stunden ago.”

“Wind’s in our favor,” I said, automatically glancing up to check.

He looked at me again, more closely this time.

“Karl taught you gut,” he said.

I stiffened.

“Who?” I asked.

“The one you smell like,” he said, amused. “Old smoke, dog, and bad jokes. Ottermand, ja? There are not so many like him out here.”

Something in my chest unclenched. The world felt a little less random.

“You know him?” I asked.

“Know of him,” Enzo said. “Man who walks with shepherd and ghosts. We traded once. Long time ago. You are friend?”

“He saved my life,” I said. “So… more than that.”

Enzo nodded like that made sense.

“Then you have chance,” he said. “If you lived with Ottermand a year and did not die, you are either very stubborn or very lucky.”

“Both,” I said.

He grinned again, then jabbed a finger toward the tracks.

“Come,” he said. “Let’s make him proud and bring something back, ja?”

We followed the tracks into the trees.

They weren’t real woods—just a stubborn patch of what had once been a park, maybe. Thin trees with bare branches, shrubs half-buried in snow, the ghost of a path winding through.

Enzo moved slower now. I matched his pace, setting each foot where he set his, keeping my breathing quiet.

The prints led deeper in, curving along a shallow dip in the ground. We followed them over a small rise and stopped together at the same instant.

There, in the hollow beyond, three roe deer picked their way through the snow. Small, delicate things, more leg than anything else. Their coats were winter-dull, blending with the dead grass. Steam puffed from their nostrils in thin clouds as they nosed for something edible.

“Zwei Ricken, ein Bock,” Enzo breathed. Two does, one buck. “We take one. No more.”

He studied the wind again, then pointed to a broken chunk of concrete a few meters ahead.

“You go there,” he said. “Lie down. Wait. I stay here. If you miss, I try. But besser, you do not miss, hm?”

“Got it,” I whispered.

I eased forward, keeping low, rifle hugged close. The concrete chunk gave me just enough height to see over the rise while staying mostly hidden. I slid into position, laid the rifle along the edge, and let my cheek find the familiar place on the stock.

Breath in. The cold burned my lungs. Breath out. The world narrowed down.

One of the does lifted her head, ears flicking. I stayed still. The buck turned slightly, quartering away, giving me a clean line just behind the shoulder.

Breath in.

*Don’t snatch, don’t hurry.* Karl’s voice again. *You’re not fighting the trigger. You’re asking nicely.*

Breath out. On the pause at the bottom, I squeezed.

The crack of the shot snapped through the quiet. Birds exploded out of the nearby trees in a panic of wings. The buck jerked, stumbled, and crashed into the snow. The does bolted, white rumps flashing, vanished between the trunks.

Silence dropped back in, heavier.

My heart hammered against my ribs. I kept the rifle up for another second, watching. The buck didn’t get up.

Enzo let out a low, approving whistle behind me.

“Sauber,” he said as I pushed myself to my knees. Clean. “Come. Schnell. Before something else thinks it is Einladung zum Essen.” An invitation to dinner.

Up close, the deer looked smaller than it had through the sights. Its eyes were still open, glassing over. A dark stain spread under it, soaking into the snow.

Guilt pricked at me for a heartbeat, sharp and small. Then the practical part of my brain shoved it aside with the reminder that this was the difference between eating and not.

Enzo knelt, checked the entry and exit wound, then patted my shoulder.

“Good shot,” he said. “Ottermand would be… how you say… zufrieden. Satisfied.”

“High praise,” I said.

He grinned.

“Now the boring part,” he said. “We get it home.”

Dragging a roe deer through broken ground wasn’t as bad as dragging a moose, but my shoulders still hated me for it by the time Rustfield’s walls came back into view. Enzo took the front most of the way, the rope over his shoulder. I took the back, lifting the head just enough to keep it from catching on every piece of rubble.

The guards on the wall had clearly seen us long before we were close. By the time we reached the gate, it was already grinding open.

Mira stood just inside, arms folded. Jonas was on the platform above her, leaning on his rifle.

“You are back in one piece,” Mira said. “That is… promising.”

Enzo jerked his chin at the deer.

“Junger hier hat ihn gelegt,” he said. The kid here dropped it. “Erster Schuss.” First shot.

Mira’s eyes flicked to me, then to the animal, then back.

“Gut,” she said simply. “We can use that.”

Two other Rustfield people came forward with hooks and a stretcher rigged out of old metal grating. They hoisted the deer with practiced ease and carried it toward what looked like a butcher’s corner—tarps, drains cut into the concrete, hooks already hanging empty.

Enzo clapped my shoulder once.

“I go argue for best pieces,” he said. “Perks of being old.” He winked and peeled off after the others.

I stood there, suddenly unsure what to do with my hands now that they weren’t holding a rope.

Mira watched me for another moment.

“You did what you said you can do,” she said. “That is rare.”

“Did you expect me to lie?” I asked.

“Everyone lies a little at the gate,” she said. “Fear makes big promises.”

She jerked her head toward the inner part of the camp.

“Come,” she said. “You have earned more than a box and a bucket.”

We walked through Rustfield again, this time without Elias shadowing every step like I might explode. The same people were there—the ones by the barrels, the ones carrying scrap, the ones arguing quietly over a broken piece of machinery—but their looks had shifted by a degree. Less *who’s that* and more *let’s see if he lasts.*

Mira led me down a narrower lane between stacked containers, then turned toward one of the older buildings—a squat two-story structure of brick and concrete, its windows boarded on the outside but patched on the inside with plastic and scrap.

“Altbau,” she said. Old building. “Before all this.”

Inside, the air was warmer. Not comfortable, but warmer. The hallway walls were scarred but solid. Doors lined both sides, some open to show glimpses of cramped rooms: bunks, blankets, small piles of personal junk.

She stopped at a door halfway down and pushed it open.

The room on the other side was small. Bed, not just a cot. Actual mattress, thin but there. A shelf cobbled together from crates. A chair. A nail in the wall with a hook for a coat. A little square of window patched with cloudy plastic that let in a smear of grey light.

It looked like luxury.

“This one is frei,” Mira said. Free. “You don’t share—for now. You work, you keep it. You make trouble, you lose it. Simple.”

I stepped inside, dropped my bag onto the bed, and had to put a hand on the wall for a second because of how much that simple motion hit.

A bed that was *mine.* A door that closed from the inside.

“Thank you,” I said. It didn’t feel like enough, but it was all I had.

“Don’t thank me,” she said. “Thank the Reh. And that you did not miss.”

She hesitated, then added, “You get your pistol back tonight. Beim Abendessen.” At dinner.

“Good to know,” I said. “I was starting to miss the weight.”

Mira nodded once, turned to go, then paused in the doorway.

“Alexander,” she said. “One more thing.”

“Yeah?”

“You are inside walls again,” she said. “But this is not Berlin. Here, people see you. If you want to stay, you let them. Verstanden?”

I thought of numbered doors, ration lines, the way nobody looked at your face longer than they had to.

“Yeah,” I said. “Understood.”

She gave a short nod and left, pulling the door closed behind her.

The latch clicked. No lock this time. Not on my side.

I sat down on the bed. The mattress gave a little under me, springs protesting but holding. I could still hear Rustfield through the walls—voices, footsteps, distant clatter—but it felt one step removed now.

I took the compass from my pocket and set it on the shelf. The needle twitched, settled north. I laid the notebook beside it, then the pen.

For the first time since I’d left Karl’s barn, I had enough safety, light, and energy in the same place to write.

I stretched out on the bed for a moment instead, staring at the patched window.

*You wanted out,* I thought. *You got it. You wanted a story you could live in. Well. Here you are, chapter whatever this is.*

I let my eyes close, just for a second.

I’d think about what came next after I could feel my hands again.

For now, I had something I hadn’t had since Berlin.

A room. Four walls. A door.

Not a cell.

A place to breathe.

And, for a little while at least, to rest.

Morning in Rustfield sounded different.

In Berlin, the day started with speakers and boots and pipes knocking in the walls. Here it started with wood.

Boards creaked. Someone walked past my door with a heavy tread. A cough hacked through the hall. Somewhere outside, metal clanged against metal in a rhythm that sounded like someone who’d been fixing the same thing for years.

I lay there for a minute and stared at the patched plastic over the little window. The light bleeding through was thin and grey, enough to turn the room from black to shapes.

For a second I didn’t recognize the shapes.

Bed. Shelf. Chair. My bag on the floor. The compass on the crate, needle holding north like it didn’t care where I was.

Then it all slotted back into place.

Rustfield. Not Berlin. Not Karl’s barn. New walls. New rules.

My body felt like it had been hit by something large. Which, technically, it had: travel, fear, the last few days’ worth of adrenaline. Muscles ached in new places. My feet hated me.

Still better than frozen concrete.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed and sat up. The floor was cold, but not the kind of cold that went straight to the bone. I spat dry taste out of my mouth, scrubbed both hands over my face, and listened.

Voices drifted through the wall. Low, blurry, overlapping. Someone laughed once, fast. A baby cried somewhere in the building, got shushed. The smell of woodsmoke and cooked something seeped under the door.

I pulled on my boots and jacket and stepped out into the hallway.

It was narrow and a little too low, the kind of place built for another purpose and reused because nobody had anything better. Doors on both sides, some open, some closed. A woman in a heavy sweater shuffled past me with a bucket, nodded once without slowing. Grey in her hair, lines at the corners of her eyes, expression set to permanent tired.

“’Morgen,” she muttered.

“Morning,” I answered automatically.

Two kids sat on the floor down the hall, backs to the wall, sharing a chipped plastic bowl of something steaming. Both too thin. One had a knitted hat with one ear missing, the yarn unraveling. They watched me like I might take their food, then decided I wasn’t worth the effort and went back to eating.

I took the stairs down.

The building opened onto one of Rustfield’s main lanes. Containers stacked two high formed a crooked corridor. Tarps hung overhead in sagging sheets, turning the light into a dirty, smoke-tinted haze. The ground under my boots was a mix of old concrete and frozen mud.

People were already moving.

A man with a shaved head and a welding mask pushed it up to wipe his forehead, revealing half a dozen burn scars. A young woman in a patched coat carried a crate of scrap past, lips cracked from the cold, hands bare. A little further down, an older guy in a wheelchair maneuvered himself toward a barrel fire, a blanket thrown over his legs, jaw working like he was chewing ghosts.

Nobody looked relaxed. Nobody looked surprised to see me either. Just one more body edging into their routines.

A voice called out from my right.

“Colt!”

I turned.

Jonas leaned against a support beam near the gate lane, rifle slung, red strip around his arm. He was halfway through a chunk of bread, chewing like he’d forgotten what tasting was.

“Du lebst noch,” he said around it. You’re still alive. “Good sign.”

“I try not to make a habit of dying,” I said, walking over. “Morning.”

He nodded at my jacket, then at the sky.

“Eat yet?” he asked.

“Not yet, no.”

He jerked his thumb toward a makeshift stall—just a table under a tarp, a big pot steaming on top, a woman ladling out servings while people queued.

“Get porridge before we go,” he said. “Enzo’s already grumpy. Don’t go out hungry. We don’t carry back two bodies.”

“Two?” I asked. “Who’s the second?”

He smirked. “He says it would be him. I say it would be you. We bet. Don’t make me lose.”

“That’s comforting,” I muttered, but my feet were already taking me toward the pot.

The breakfast line was short. The woman behind the table—mid-fifties, maybe, shoulders broad, hair braided tight against her skull—eyed the wooden bowl Jonas had tossed me.

“First morning?” she asked, voice rough from too many years of shouting over noise.

“Yeah,” I said. “Alexander.”

She filled the bowl with something thick and pale and steaming.

“Gretel,” she said. “You eat all of it. No leaving. I see scraps, I throw the spoon at your head.”

“I believe you,” I said.

She almost smiled. Almost.

I leaned against a container and inhaled the porridge. It tasted like oats and some kind of root, maybe, with a hint of salt. Nothing impressive. Nothing terrible. Just hot and heavy and exactly what my stomach had been waiting for.

While I ate, I watched.

Rustfield was busier than yesterday. Less spectacle, more rhythm.

Near the center, a fenced-off area held a couple of raised beds under cracked plastic—someone’s attempt at a garden. A woman in a wool cap checked on the shriveled plants inside, face unreadable. Kids darted around the edges of the lanes, weaving between adults, getting cuffed lightly when they got too close to fires or moving loads.

By one of the fires, a tall guy with a crooked nose and tattoos up his neck sharpened a knife with slow, careful strokes. He talked quietly with another man I recognized from the gate—Elias—voices too low to catch words.

A lanky figure with tangled hair sat on an overturned crate near the wall, guitar in his lap, fingers picking at strings that only half wanted to stay in tune. The sound drifted through the camp like it didn’t know if it was allowed.

None of them were the clean, pressed silhouettes from Berlin propaganda.

They were just… people. Scarred up, worn down, still moving.

“Colt!”

This time the shout came from the gate.

Enzo stood there, rifle strapped over one shoulder, coat zipped up to his throat, breath ghosting out in short bursts. He waved me over like I was late.

“You eat, oder was?” he called. Or what?

I lifted the empty bowl and wiggled it at him.

“Cleaned it,” I said.

“Gut,” he replied. “Then we work.”

Gretel took my bowl without looking, already filling another for the next person. I joined Enzo at the gate.

Mira was there too, talking with one of the wall guards. She raised a hand to stop us as we approached.

“Route?” she asked Enzo.

“North-east,” he said. “Park zone. Check snares, maybe find Reh if we are lucky.” Deer.

She turned her eyes on me.

“You remember yesterday’s Regeln?” she asked. Rules.

“Don’t fire in camp. Don’t touch anything with hazard signs. Don’t be a problem,” I said. “Rough summary.”

“And outside?” she pressed.

“Don’t poke things that hum,” I said. “Run instead of fight if you can. Don’t shoot anything unless you’re sure.”

She gave a small, approving nod.

“Gut,” she said. “You bring him back, Enzo.”

“I try,” Enzo said. “No Garantie.” No guarantees.

Mira’s mouth twitched like she wasn’t sure if she wanted to smile or not.

“Open,” she called up.

The gate ground aside.

Outside, the air hit harder. Open space again, horizon broken only by ruins and trees. The city’s dead bones spread out in every direction.

Enzo adjusted his scarf.

“You walk left,” he said. “Not in front, not behind. If I stop, you stop. If I say ‘run,’ you don’t ask why. You already know, ja?”

“Ja,” I said.

He snorted. “Look at that. Karl’s boy learning fast.”

We moved.

The world beyond Rustfield felt different now that I had somewhere to go back to. Less like a mouth waiting to close on me, more like something I was allowed to walk through. Still dangerous. Still cold. But not infinite.

We cut through broken streets and around a collapsed tram line, past a half-fallen shopping center whose old glass doors lay shattered in glittering drifts.

“So,” Enzo said after a while, voice low but casual. “First night? Sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Door didn’t lock from the outside. Took me a minute to believe it.”

He huffed.

“First night I slept here, I kept my boots on,” he said. “Thought if I had to run, I would not waste time.”

“Did you?” I asked.

“Did I run?” he said. “Ja. In my head. Whole night.”

“Better cardio than I get,” I said.

He chuckled.

“You meet some Leute already?” he asked. People. “Gretel, Jonas…?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Gretel threatened me with a spoon. Felt like affection. Jonas made a bet on whether I’d die today. Also affection.”

Enzo grinned.

“He likes you,” he said. “He only jokes with people he thinks might survive long enough to get annoyed.”

“Comforting,” I muttered.

Enzo nudged my shoulder with his.

“You don’t like jokes?” he asked.

“I like not dying more,” I said. “Jokes are a close second.”

“Good priorities,” he said. “Keep them.”

We walked in comfortable silence for a bit.

A row of old houses loomed on our right, windows blown out, fronts tagged with faded paint. One had a door still clinging to its hinges, half-open, snow piled against it.

“Anyone live out here?” I asked.

“Not if they are smart,” Enzo said. “Too close to us. Too close to… other things. If you see smoke out here, it is either someone very desperate, or something you don’t want to meet.”

“Mutants?” I asked.

He shrugged.

“Sometimes,” he said. “Sometimes hungry people. Sometimes old tech that wakes up and tries to finish a war nobody remembers.”

“Seen one?” I pressed.

He gave me a sideways glance.

“You will know when you see,” he said. “And when you hear. They are not quiet.”

We left the houses behind and cut into a stand of thin trees. The snow under our boots softened the sound.

“Rustfield,” I said. “Whose idea was it?”

He shifted the rifle on his shoulder.

“Started as an outpost,” he said. “Three shacks, one antenna, two idiots who thought they could farm rust off metal and sell it back to the safe zones.”

“That… didn’t work?” I guessed.

He snorted.

“Metal is everywhere,” he said. “You don’t build a life on something everybody can steal for free. But people needed a place to stand that wasn’t behind the walls or under someone’s boot. They came. Brought skills. Brought problems. Camp grew.”

“And now?” I asked. “Who runs it? Mira?”

“Mira runs guards,” he said. “Lars runs generators and water. Gretel runs kitchen. Else runs clinic. They shout at each other, then make it work. If they stop shouting, be afraid.”

“So it’s like the Safe Zone council,” I said. “Only useful.”

Enzo barked a laugh.

“You say that too loud, some people hit you,” he said. “But ja. Here, if you don’t do your job, people notice fast.”

We reached a small clearing. Enzo slowed, lifted a hand.

“Here,” he said. “First snares.”

He showed me how they’d set them—thin wire loops tucked clever into animal paths, bait barely visible under snow. A couple were sprung and empty; one held a half-frozen rabbit.

“Not much meat,” he said, slipping it free with quick, efficient motions. “But better than nothing.”

He tossed it in my direction. I caught it by reflex.

“Congratulations,” he added. “You carry lunch.”

“Lucky me,” I said.

We checked three more lines. One more rabbit, one empty, one ripped apart.

Something had gotten there first. The snow around it was scuffed with prints I didn’t recognize.

Enzo crouched, brows drawing together.

“Wolf?” I asked.

He shook his head.

“Too light,” he said. “Fox, vielleicht. Maybe. Or dog.”

“Dog?” I echoed. “Wild?”

“Sometimes people set them free when they cannot feed them,” he said. “Sometimes they run.”

“Better than eating them,” I muttered.

He didn’t answer.

We moved on.

Late morning bled into early afternoon. The sky never really changed color, just shifted from one shade of dirty grey to another.

We spotted deer sign around a line of old trees—droppings, tracks, a branch nibbled clean. Enzo took the lead without speaking. I followed, breath slow, rifle loose in my hands.

It wasn’t exciting. It wasn’t cinematic. It was just walking and stopping and listening until your muscles screamed and your brain swore there was nothing out there worth finding.

We found them anyway.

Three roe again, feeding in a dip between two humps of snow. Not far from where yesterday’s had fallen, but not the same place. They lifted their heads almost in sync when the wind shifted.

Enzo looked at me, then pointed with his chin.

“You see?” he whispered.

“Yeah,” I murmured. “Same plan?”

“You go,” he said. “I watch your back. Remember, we bring something home, not glory.”

I crept to a low piece of concrete, lay prone, and lined up the shot.

Not much to say about it. Breath, sight, trigger, crack. One dropped. The others bolted.

Routine. Work.

On the way back, dragging the carcass between us, my shoulders burning, I realized that whatever else Rustfield was, it had a heartbeat.

Broken. Stressed. Too fast sometimes.

But it was a pulse.


The next eight days blurred into each other, the way days do when they’re full of the same motions and the same tired faces.

Morning porridge. Gretel’s threats. Jonas at the gate with a comment and a smirk.

Enzo waiting with his rifle and a “komm, Colt, move your ass.”

Out, through the gate. The world beyond changing in small ways—more snow one day, less the next; different tracks; a building that had collapsed a little more overnight with a sound nobody had been close enough to hear.

Hunts that went well. Hunts that didn’t. Some days we came back with deer, or a couple of rabbits, or a bird unlucky enough to be where Enzo’s patience and my aim lined up. Some days we came back with nothing but cold fingers and empty hands.

The routine after was always the same. Gates opening. Mira at the post, expression measuring and impassive. Meat taken to the butcher corner. Blood washed off hands in water that bit like knives. Weapons checked, cleaned, stored.

Afternoons were chores.

Stacking wood. Helping patch holes in tarps and walls. Carrying crates for Lars while he climbed around the generators and cursed at them under his breath. Holding a light for Else in the clinic once while she stitched a gash in a guy’s arm, her hands steady enough that the needle might as well have been an extra finger.

“Don’t look away,” she’d told me when I flinched at the first pull of the thread. “If you’re going to live out here, you learn what it costs. Close your eyes later.”

I’d kept them open. I still saw it that night.

Names attached themselves slowly to faces.

The guitar guy was Emil. He’d come from somewhere east, never said exactly where, and his fingers were missing the tip of one pinkie. He played mostly for himself. Sometimes for the kids if they were quiet.

The older guy in the wheelchair was Helmut. Used to run with some convoy years back until something ran over him instead. Now he sat by the fires and told people what they were doing wrong, whether they asked or not.

The woman tending the garden was Amina. She almost never smiled, but when she did it was usually at the plants, not people.

Nobody asked for my life story. Nobody told me theirs without a reason. You earned those pieces over time. Over shared shifts, shared scares, shared cigarettes if you were into that kind of slow suicide.

Enzo talked the most.

Not all at once. Little bits, scattered between checking snares and crossing open ground.

A story about his mother laughing too loud at some joke in an old kitchen. A comment about his father hating the Safe Zones before they even existed. An offhand remark about almost getting shot on a job south of here because someone didn’t know the difference between “cover me” and “run.”

He never gave a full timeline. Just fragments. Enough to stitch an outline together if you paid attention.

Karl would have liked him. Grumbled about his habits. Argued with him. Probably trusted him anyway.

I thought about Karl more in those days than I said out loud.

At night, in my little room, I’d sit on the bed with the notebook open and write until my hand cramped. Not just what happened, but how it felt. The way Rustfield smelled at dusk. The way Mira’s voice carried without having to shout. The way fear and routine sat next to each other in everyone’s eyes.

On the eighth day, the routine broke my leg.
 

We were further out than usual.

Not by much. Just one more kilometer, one more line of trees, one more old road funneling us into what Enzo called “good ground” and I called “probably a bad idea.”

Snow had built up in deceptive ways. It looked flat until you stepped on it and dropped into a hidden ditch. I’d already done that twice, swearing and yanking my foot out of holes full of broken brick.

The tracks we followed were fresh. Bigger than roe. Heavier.

“Moose?” I asked, because that’s what it looked like.

Enzo nodded once, serious. The usual jokes sat this one out.

“Alces,” he said. “Bull, I think. Big. We get this home, Gretel sings for us.”

“Gretel can sing?” I said.

“She pretends she cannot,” he said. “She lies.”

We moved slower.

Every crack of ice, every crunch of snow felt too loud. The bare trees around us were tall enough to give cover but thin enough that you were never really hidden.

I could feel the cold through my gloves where I held the rifle. But I also felt something else.

Greed.

One moose meant a lot of meat. Fat. Bones for broth. Hide for repair. A dozen small luxuries in a place where everything was a compromise.

“Careful,” Enzo murmured, as if he’d plucked the thought out of my skull. “They are stupid and angry. Like some people.”

“You’ve hunted them before?” I asked.

“Once,” he said. “We brought three men. Only two came back. Moose came back too. In pieces.”

“Comforting story,” I said.

“Ja,” he said. “Pay attention.”

We found it in a shallow valley between two rises.

Big doesn’t really cover it. It was massive. Taller at the shoulder than I was. Dark coat frosted at the edges, breath steaming in thick puffs. Its antlers were smaller than some pictures I’d seen, which meant it was either young or had lost half in some old fight.

It stood near a cluster of leafless bushes, ripping twigs off with its teeth.

We stayed above it, on the right-hand slope, tucked behind a dead tree and a pile of old rubble.

“Wind?” Enzo whispered.

“In our favor,” I said. “For now.”

He nodded.

“Distance?”

“Hundred… fifty?” I guessed.

He squinted, then tilted his head in grudging agreement.

“Close enough,” he said. “Too close if we are dumm. You take first shot. Aim low on the shoulder. If it charges, you do not stand there and think about your life choices. You move.”

“Got it,” I said.

My heart was already beating too fast.

I lay down in the snow, elbows braced, rifle snug into my shoulder. Breath clouded the scope. I shifted my head until the glass cleared.

The moose filled the sight. It turned its head slowly, chewing. Its eye flicked in our direction once, briefly, then back to whatever its dumb brain cared about.

I slowed my breathing.

In. Out. In.

The wind brushed along my cheek. The world tightened down to crossing lines and meat and the thin space between.

I squeezed the trigger.

The shot cracked the cold open. A splash of dark red bloomed against the moose’s side.

It jerked, staggered, bellowed. The sound rattled my chest.

For a second I thought it might drop.

It didn’t.

It turned.

Not away. Not to run.

Up the slope.

Toward us.

“Shit,” I breathed.

“Run!” Enzo snapped.

I scrambled up, boots slipping in loose snow, rifle half-forgotten in my hands. The ground felt like it was moving under me. I made it three steps sideways before my foot hit a patch of ice hidden under powder.

I went down hard.

The world tilted. Sky, trees, animal, all at wrong angles.

I heard Enzo fire once, twice. The moose grunted, but its momentum didn’t change.

I rolled, trying to get my legs under me.

Too slow.

The moose hit.

Not full-on. If it had, that would have been it. Just a glancing blow from its shoulder and chest as it barreled past, its front leg catching mine.

Pain detonated in my lower right leg—sharp, blinding, hot. Something in there gave with a wet, sick crack.

I screamed without meaning to. The sound came out thin and high in the cold air.

The world narrowed to that one spot.

I felt more than saw the moose stumble as another shot hit. It crashed into a tree, snapped smaller branches like kindling, then went down in a heap that shook the ground.

Silence crashed in over the ringing in my ears.

My breath came in ragged gasps. Every tiny shift sent another bolt of pain up my leg. My hands clawed at the snow, as if I could pull myself away from my own bones.

“Colt!”

Enzo slid into view, boots digging furrows in the snow, rifle already slung.

“Don’t move,” he said. “Bleib liegen. Stay down.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” I hissed through clenched teeth. “Shit—”

He knelt by my leg, eyes flicking over it.

Even through the layers of pants and insulation, we could both see it. The wrong angle. The swelling already starting. The way my foot wanted to point in a direction ankles weren’t designed for.

“Gebrochen,” he said. Broken.

“No kidding,” I groaned.

He pressed his glove just above the worst part. The pressure sent another flash of white-hot agony up my side. I bit back another scream and tasted blood where I’d bitten my tongue.

“Can you feel the foot?” he asked. “Zehen. Toes.”

“Yeah,” I gasped. “They hate me.”

“Gut,” he said. “That’s something.”

He looked over his shoulder at the moose, then back at me, and I saw the calculation in his eyes.

Meat. Time. Distance to Rustfield. How many hands he had. How much daylight was left.

“Leave it,” I said, already knowing the answer. “You can come back.”

He shook his head.

“If I leave you here, you are bait,” he said. “We move you first. Then Fleisch.” The meat. “Moose is dead. It waits.”

“How far are we?” I asked.

“Zu weit,” he muttered. Too far. “But we try anyway.”

He stripped his pack off and yanked loose a coil of rope. I watched through a haze as he moved, hands efficient even with the tension in his jaw.

He found a broken door half-buried in the snow—a slab of old composite wood and metal from some forgotten building. He kicked it free and dragged it over, the sound grating and ugly.

“Sled?” I asked.

“Ja,” he said. “Hospitals are full. We improvise.”

He cut one of my pant legs open with his knife, exposing the mess underneath.

The skin over my shin bulged in the wrong place. No bones poking through, but only just. Bruising was already blooming. The sight made my stomach flip.

“Look at me,” he said sharply. “Not at that.”

I dragged my eyes up to his face.

“This will hurt,” he said.

“I already hate it,” I replied.

He took a length of cloth from his pack—an old scarf—and shoved it into my hand.

“Bite,” he said. “Trust me.”

I did.

He didn’t warn me before he moved the leg.

One hand braced under my calf, the other on my ankle, he pulled and twisted in one smooth motion. The world went white around the edges.

The scream that tore out of me stayed mostly in the scarf.

When the flare of pain settled back into a roar, the leg looked… less wrong. Still bad. But less.

I spat the scarf out, panting.

“You okay?” Enzo asked.

“Define okay,” I rasped.

He snorted.

“Good,” he said. “You can still be an asshole. Means you’re alive.”

He splinted the leg with two pieces of broken board and some more cloth, binding it tight enough that I saw spots again. Then he and I slid me onto the makeshift sled.

Every bump, every shift, every inch grated through bone and muscle. I tried to clench my jaw and ride it out. Didn’t always work.

When he finally got me settled, he looped the rope over his shoulders and stood.

“You hold on,” he said. “If you fall off, I leave you. I am not lifting you twice.”

“You’re all heart,” I muttered, fingers already gripping the sled’s edge hard enough to hurt.

He took the weight and started to pull.

The first few meters were the worst. My body didn’t know which part to focus on, so it just screamed everywhere. Sweat prickled down my back despite the cold.

We left the moose where it lay, a dark heap against the snow. Enzo didn’t look back at it.

“Can you… come back for it?” I asked after a while, because the guilt was right there, thick and stupid.

“If we have time,” he said, breath already coming heavier. “If not, someone else takes it. Or something. Not our biggest problem now.”

“You’re going to throw this in my face forever,” I said. “’Remember when you made me drag you and a broken leg for two hours?’”

“Ja,” he said. “At least.”

His boots dug furrows in the snow, shoulders straining. Every rise, no matter how small, turned into a hill. Every patch of rough ground amplified the pain in my leg.

“How far?” I asked at one point.

“Stop asking,” he grunted. “You don’t want the answer.”

I shut up.

Time turned into a smear of trees and sky and Enzo’s back and my own breathing. Once, a sound in the distance made him freeze and drop into a crouch, hand on his rifle.

We both listened.

A howl. Long, low, far away.

“Wolves?” I asked.

“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe something that ate a wolf once. Either way, keep quiet.”

He stayed like that for a full minute, every muscle ready to move. Then he straightened and started pulling again.

At some point the sky shifted to a darker grey. My fingers went numb on the sled even through gloves. My leg felt like it was on fire and frozen solid at the same time.

We saw Rustfield’s walls from a distance before I realized how far we’d made it.

They rose out of the ruins like they’d always been there—patched together from old steel, containers, whatever people had found. Smoke curled over the top, carried sideways by the wind.

“Almost,” Enzo panted. “Fast now.”

He put his head down and pulled harder.

By the time we reached the gate, my world had shrunk down to the scrape of the sled and the taste of bile in the back of my throat.

Voices shouted. Boots pounded. The gate groaned open quicker than I’d ever seen.

Jonas appeared in my field of view, moving fast, red band bright against his jacket.

“What the hell happened?” he demanded, already grabbing the back of the sled to help.

“Moose,” Enzo said. “Moose with bad attitude.”

“Scheiße,” Jonas muttered.

They dragged me inside together.

Faces appeared and blurred away. Mira, sharp and focused, barking orders. Gretel, hands on hips, Maul tight. Emil, guitar nowhere in sight, eyes wide.

“Clinic,” Mira snapped. “Sofort. Else knows.”

The sled bumped over the uneven ground. I bit my lip hard enough to taste copper. Somewhere in the mess of noise, I thought I heard someone say, “Broken?” and someone else reply, “Looks like.”

Else’s face appeared above me as they hauled me into the clinic—a cramped space that smelled like alcohol, blood, and worn-out hope.

“On the table,” she said. “Careful. Don’t touch the leg more than you have to.”

They lifted me. My leg screamed. I did too. No point pretending otherwise.

Else leaned over, eyes already scanning, hands gentle but firm.

“Glückwunsch,” she said dryly. Congratulations. “You lasted eight days before we had to patch you properly. New record.”

I managed a ragged laugh.

“Will I live?” I croaked.

She met my eyes.

“Probably,” she said. “If you don’t do anything dumm in the next few weeks. Which, looking at you, is… fifty-fifty.”

She looked past me, at Enzo.

“You did good,” she said. “Now get out of my way.”

He stepped back, breath still heavy, face glistening with sweat under the grime.

As Else reached for a saw and more splints, painkillers already in her other hand, I let my head drop back against the table.

The last thing I saw before the world blurred was Enzo in the doorway, shoulders slumped, hands on his knees, eyes on me like he wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or annoyed.

Then the injection hit, warm and dark, and the pain loosened its grip just enough for everything to go soft around the edges.

Somewhere, under all of it, a stupid thought floated up.

*At least Karl would say I’m doing it right. If you’re going to live out here, break something real at least once.*

Then even that slipped away.

Pain brought me back first.

Not all at once. Just enough to remind me my leg existed and hated me.

I floated in and out of a warm, heavy dark. Voices came and went on the surface—muffled, distant.

“…hold him still…”

“…it’s set, stop hovering…”

“…if he tears it again, I’m not wasting more plaster…”

Sometimes I caught a laugh I thought was Jonas. Once I heard Enzo swear softly in whatever language he swore in when German didn’t cut it.

Every time I came up properly, the pain was a little clearer.

At first it was a deep, dull throb somewhere around my shin, wrapped in cotton and stone. Later it turned sharp at the edges, like the bone itself was breathing against the cast.

The first time I really woke, the ceiling over me was stained boards and a greasy strip of sheet metal. Else’s clinic. A small stove glowed orange in the corner. The air smelled like disinfectant, boiled herbs, and people who’d been sick in here before me.

Else stood beside the bed, hair tied back, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Her hands were on my leg, fingers pressing along the thick plaster.

“Welcome back,” she said, as if I’d just overslept.

My throat felt like I’d swallowed sand.

“How bad?” I croaked.

She handed me a cup first. “Drink. Then talk.”

The water was lukewarm metal and dust. It tasted incredible.

Only then did I look properly.

My right leg was swallowed by a rough plaster cast from just below the knee to the ankle, wrapped in strips of fabric, reinforced with thin metal splints. Someone had done their best with not enough.

“Broken in two places,” Else said. “You’re lucky. Could have been three. Or out through the skin.” She straightened. “You keep still for three days. No heroics. Then we see if you’re worth the wood for crutches.”

“Good to know you value me at least that much,” I muttered.

“If I didn’t, I’d have left you for the moose,” she said, deadpan.

“Enzo okay?” I asked. “He didn’t…?”

“He’s fine,” she said. “His pride hurts. His back hurts. He’ll live.”

I let my head hit the pillow again. The room tilted.

“Next time,” I muttered, “I’ll try not to headbutt the wildlife.”

“Next time,” she said, “you shoot deeper. Or don’t stand in front of the horns.”

The first three days blurred together.

Else dosed me on a schedule she kept in her head. Just when the pain started to turn white-hot, she’d appear with a syringe or a bitter drink and shove me back under the surface.

I slept. I sweated. I drifted.

Faces came and went.

Gretel, dropping off bowls of soup and leaning over me with that permanent frown of hers.

“You eat,” she ordered. “Bones need material. I don’t serve air.”

Jonas in the doorway, leaning on his rifle, pretending he’d just happened to pass by.

“North watch saw lights last night,” he said one evening. “Far out. Could be a caravan. Could be idiots playing with fire. Either way, they stayed out there. Lucky them.”

“Mutants?” I asked, because the posters in my head still wanted something to blame.

He shrugged. “Mutants don’t usually announce themselves with lanterns,” he said. “Whatever it was, Mira said we watch and wait. So we watched. Now we wait.”

Enzo came in once the second day, shoulders still tight from dragging both me and half a moose home.

He hovered near the foot of the bed, as if coming closer might knock something loose.

“You picked the wrong time to get brave,” he said finally.

“Didn’t know there was a schedule,” I muttered.

His mouth twitched.

“You scared the shit out of me,” he said. “Thought I’d have to explain to Mira why I came back with meat and half a corpse.”

“You could’ve just blamed the moose,” I said.

“Believe me, I tried,” he said.

Else kicked him out after ten minutes.

“Either you bring him food or you leave,” she snapped. “He needs rest, not your guilt.”

Enzo gave me a look on the way out. Something between apology and annoyance.

“Next time you want to impress the camp,” he said, “do it with paperwork.”


On the morning of the fourth day, Else came in carrying two pieces of wood.

“Congratulations,” she said. “You get promoted.”

I stared at the crutches.

“They look like they were built by someone who hates joints,” I said.

“Take that up with the carpenter,” she said. “He hates everyone. Sit up.”

Getting vertical was its own little war.

My arms shook. My ribs complained. The leg in the cast lit up the second I tried to move it.

“Breathe,” Else snapped. “You don’t faint on me. I don’t have space on the floor for you.”

“You’re very comforting, you know that?” I grunted.

She planted the crutches in front of me.

“Stand,” she said. “One leg. Use your arms. The cast does not touch the ground. If it does, I will personally break the other one to remind you how it felt.”

I believed her.

I pushed myself up. My shoulders took most of it. My good leg wobbled. The room swayed for a second, then settled.

“Gut,” she said. “Now: door, back, twice. Then you rest.”

It wasn’t walking. It was inching the world past me in little jerks of wood and muscle.

Left crutch, right crutch, good foot. Lift. Repeat.

By the time I’d reached the door and turned around, sweat ran cold down my back. My hands ached. My armpits hurt in muscles I didn’t know existed.

Else watched, arms crossed, expression somewhere between satisfied and annoyed.

“You do this three times a day,” she said. “You stop when your leg starts screaming like first day. You ignore it when it’s only complaining like second day.”

“What if it starts negotiating?” I panted.

“Then you tell it no,” she said, completely serious.

A week in, I was sick of the clinic walls. Sick of the stove. Sick of the ceiling. Sick of waking up to the same four boards and hearing other people’s pain through thin partitions.

Else got sick of me first.

“You’re driving me crazy,” she said that morning. “Go be useless somewhere else.”

“Is that a medical order?” I asked.

“Yes,” she said. “If you stay, I sedate you until spring.”

Jonas and Enzo helped haul me back to my room—one under each arm, my crutches bumping every wall.

“Careful on the stairs,” Jonas muttered. “If you fall, I’m not hauling you back up. I’ll say you deserted.”

“Very funny,” I gritted.

Enzo snorted. “If he falls, I push you down after,” he said to Jonas. “Keep balance.”

“Everyone’s so supportive,” I said.

Mira was waiting at the bottom of my stairs, hands in her jacket pockets. She ran her eyes over the cast, the crutches, the way I moved.

“You look terrible,” she said.

“Nice to see you too,” I replied.

“You’re off hunting for at least six weeks,” she said, matter-of-fact. “Else says if you try sooner, she’ll put you back together wrong on purpose.”

“Sounds like her,” I said.

“In the meantime,” Mira went on, “you don’t lie in bed and rot. We don’t feed ornaments.” She tilted her head. “You can read. You can write?”

“Yes,” I said. “Better than I can… hop.”

“Good,” she said. “Then you sit at a table near the gate. You help sort logs, maps, shift lists. You complain, I give you latrine duty instead.”

“I suddenly love paperwork,” I said.

“Smart,” she said, and left it at that.

Back in my room, everything was smaller than I remembered. The bed. The shelf. The square of patched plastic pretending to be a window.

I dropped onto the mattress and just sat there for a long minute, hands resting on the crutches. The cast throbbed, but the pain had already shifted from urgent to persistent. Background noise instead of a siren.

My bag was where I’d left it. I dragged it closer, fished out the notebook and pen.

If I couldn’t move far, I could at least put the last week somewhere that wasn’t my head.

I wrote about the moose—not the fall so much as the twenty seconds beforehand, the way it had turned, the small, stupid hesitation in my trigger finger.

I wrote about Else’s hands, fast and efficient, and the lines around her eyes that only showed when someone was worse off than they let her see.

I wrote about Enzo’s silence more than his jokes, Jonas’s throwaway comments about the world beyond the walls, Gretel’s way of shoving food at you like an insult that still kept you alive.

By the time my hand cramped, I felt… not better. But less full.

Two weeks in, sharp movements stopped sending lightning up my leg.

Twisting wrong still hurt like hell. Letting the cast touch the floor was a sharp warning I didn’t ignore. But I could sit, shift, even turn too fast without seeing white.

Else stripped the bandages off one morning, tapped along the bone, watched my face more than the leg.

“Healing,” she said finally. “For now. You start touch down. Light. With crutches. If it hurts like first day, you stop. If it hurts like third day, you keep going. You feel anything move that shouldn’t, you scream.”

“Define scream,” I said.

“Loud enough I hear it,” she replied.

The first time my injured heel met the floor, every muscle in my body braced for impact.

The pressure was there. Hot. Tight. But nothing snapped.

Sweat broke out along my spine anyway.

“There,” Else said. “You see? Not broken. Just angry.”

“Like you,” I said.

“You keep talking and I change that,” she said, but there was something almost like approval in her voice.

The camp changed for me when I was forced to see it slower.

On hunts, everything had been a blur of routes and angles—places to cross fast, places to watch, places to avoid.

On crutches, I saw the gaps.

The water line at the pump in the morning, people waiting with cans and buckets, trading gossip quietly so they wouldn’t forget they were human.

Gretel banging her ladle against a pot when someone tried to cut in the stew line.

The three kids who always ended up near the fire barrels, inventing games with bottle caps and old nails, their bare hands going red with cold before their parents dragged them back.

The mechanic, Emil, sitting on an overturned crate with some gutted piece of tech in his lap, tongue between his teeth as he soldered two dead worlds together into something that might flicker for one more month.

The old man, Helmut, in his chair at the same patch of fence every afternoon, blanket over his missing legs, mug in hand, watching the gate like it owed him a favor.

I ended up next to Helmut more than once, mostly because there was a crate nearby that made a decent seat.

“Sit,” he told me the first time, jabbing the crate with his mug. “You’re making the lane look uneven.”

I sat.

He nodded at my cast.

“Moose?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “Didn’t like my face.”

“Road accident,” he said, tapping the blanket over where his knees would have been. “Old truck. New ice. Dumb mix.”

“Before all this?” I asked.

“Before the walls, during *that* catastrophe.” he said. “Bad period for my balance.”

He took a drink, squinting toward the gate.

Catastrophe? Whatever.

“You going to stay?” he asked. “Or you’re one of those wanderers. Legs work again, you keep walking.”

“I don’t know yet,” I admitted.

I looked at the camp. The walls. The fires. The people who now had faces and names instead of just roles.

“I thought I’d move,” I said. “When I left Karl’s place, the plan was… keep going. See what’s out there. Don’t stop too long in one place.”

“And now?” he asked.

“Now it feels weird to picture not coming back,” I said.

Helmut grunted.

“World’s big,” he said. “Bigger than this junk pile. But walls like this?” He knocked his mug against the fence post. “Hard to find. Harder to keep. You get one, you think twice before walking off.”

“You regret leaving wherever you started?” I asked.

He stared into his mug for a moment.

“I regret thinking I had time,” he said quietly. “World likes to prove you wrong about that.”

Paperwork started as punishment and turned into something close to… power was the wrong word. Perspective.

Mira dropped a stack of old logbooks and a bundle of blank paper in front of me at the gate table one morning.

“Hunts,” she said, tapping one book. “Shifts.” Another tap. “Visitors.” A third. “They’re all mixed. Make them less stupid.”

I cracked one open.

It was chaos. Names I didn’t know. Places I’d never heard. Dated entries squeezed sideways into margins, three hands on the same page.

I sorted.

Columns. Notes. Cross-references.

Jonas drifted over on his break, leaned on his rifle and watched me draw neat little lines like this was some exotic ritual.

“You like this?” he asked.

“Like is strong,” I said. “But it keeps my brain from chewing on itself.”

He pointed at the rough map we’d sketched together over a few days.

“See here,” he said, tapping three circles he’d drawn with a dull pencil. “And here. And here.”

Each mark sat on the edge of what passed for Rustfield’s territory.

“What are those?” I asked.

“Trouble,” he said. “Not yet. But soon.”

“Bandits?”

“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe just hungry people. Group shows up there one week, gone the next, shows up closer two weeks later. Doesn’t take a genius.”

“What do you do?” I asked.

“We wait,” he said. “If we go out to them, we leave holes in here. If they come too close, we plug the holes with lead instead of bodies.”

“Nice,” I said.

“You asked,” he replied.

The fight started stupidly. That was the worst part.

A month in, I’d graduated to one crutch for short distances. Else still hated the idea of me outside the walls, but I could move almost like a person inside them.

Enzo found me at the gate table late one afternoon, hunched over a map, wrists aching.

He dropped a strip of dried meat on the paper.

“You’ll go blind,” he said. “Staring at lines all day.”

“I thought you liked me less on hunts now,” I said. “Less chance I get run over by wildlife.”

He snorted, dropped onto the bench opposite.

“How’s the leg?” he asked.

“Still attached,” I said. “Better than the moose.”

He laughed under his breath. It faded quick.

“Look,” he said. “Jokes aside—you did good out there. Before the… accident. Mira’s not going to throw you out because you need wood under your arms for a while.”

“Good to know my job security isn’t entirely tied to my ability to walk in a straight line,” I said.

He tore off a piece of meat with his teeth, chewed, watched me.

“You hate this,” he said suddenly.

“What?” I asked.

He gestured at the table, the maps, the logbooks.

“This,” he repeated. “Sitting. Writing. Waiting for bones to grow. You look at the gate like it insulted your mother.”

I bristled.

“I don’t hate it,” I said. “It’s just… not what I came out here for.”

“To shuffle paper?” he asked. “No. No one leaves walls for that.”

“I didn’t walk out of Berlin to become a crippled clerk,” I snapped, sharper than I meant.

His jaw tightened.

“You think that’s what this is?” he asked quietly. “You think the people who sit at these tables and keep track of where food comes from and where bullets go are just… clerks?”

“That’s not what I said,” I shot back.

“You said enough,” he said.

I could’ve stopped there. Should’ve.

Instead, something bitter under my ribs pushed harder.

“At least you chose this,” I said. “Rustfield. The routine. The same routes. You decided this is it for you. I didn’t come out here to… settle.”

The word came out with more contempt than I intended.

Enzo’s face changed in a small, precise way. The lines around his eyes tightened. The warmth dropped out of his voice.

“You think I chose this because I like it?” he asked. “You think I woke up one day and said, ‘ah, yes, I want to count tins and drag bleeding kids back from the snow until my knees give out’?”

I opened my mouth. Nothing useful came out.

“I stay because if I don’t, people die I could have kept alive,” he said. “That’s not ‘settling,’ Alexander. That’s what it looks like when you’re done pretending you’re the main character.”

The words landed like a slap.

“I didn’t—” I started.

“You did,” he said. “You just didn’t listen to yourself saying it.”

He stood, the bench scraping.

“Get used to boredom,” he added. “You live long enough, it’s most of what you get.”

He walked off without waiting for an answer.

I stared at the map for a long time after he left, the dried meat still sitting on it.

*Nice work,* something in me said. *Pick a man who dragged you out from under a moose and tell him he’s wasting his life. Real smooth.*

I didn’t go after him. Cowardice, pride, pain—take your pick. They all felt the same.

After that, things were… off.

Enzo wasn’t cruel. He didn’t suddenly start ignoring me at the gate or “forget” to nod when passing.

He just… pulled back a few inches.

Conversations got shorter. Jokes came slower. When I limped over to the fire where he and a few others sat after a long day, there was always a space, but it never quite felt like it was for me.

He still trained new hunters. Still went on runs. Still grumbled about everyone’s aim.

He just did it without looking my way as much.

I threw myself harder into whatever work I could do.

More maps. Cleaner logs. Long talks with Jonas on the wall at night when my leg could handle the stairs.

“Enzo mad at you?” Jonas asked once, after watching us not quite look at each other for a week.

“Disappointed,” I said. “Which is worse.”

Jonas made a face. “What did you do?”

“Opened my mouth,” I said.

He huffed. “He’ll get over it,” he said. “Or he won’t. Either way, you apologize when you mean it, not when you think he expects it.”

“When did you get wise?” I asked.

“I’m not,” he said. “I just watched a lot of idiots never say sorry until it was at a grave.”

Six weeks in, Else cut the cast down.

Not off. Not yet. But the plaster below my calf came away in chunks, leaving a tighter wrap and more room for the muscles that had been asleep to remember their job.

“You can walk,” she said. “Slow. With stick. Crutch only when it screams. You run, you fall, you come back here, I take the leg and give it to someone who uses it better.”

“Clear,” I said.

The first step without a crutch was like trying to walk on a leg full of bees.

It held. Barely. Each move was stiff and awkward. My foot didn’t quite trust the floor.

But I made it from my bed to the door and back, one hand on the wall.

Else watched, arms folded.

“Don’t get clever,” she said. “One wrong stone outside and we start again.”

“Got it,” I said.

Mira wasted no time.

“Night watch,” she said that evening, jerking her head toward the stairs. “With Jonas. You can stand. You can shout. That’s enough.”

My lungs burned more than my leg by the time I got up to the wall platform.

Rustfield at night looked different from up there. The fires were islands in a black sea. Voices rose and fell. Somewhere, Emil’s guitar plucked out a tune that never quite became a song.

Outside the walls, the ruins were hunched silhouettes. Broken buildings. Bare trees. Snow catching what little light there was.

“Welcome back to the tall world,” Jonas said, handing me a pair of battered binoculars. “Try not to drop those. They’re older than both of us.”

We walked slow circuits. Stop. Listen. Scan. Move.

“Why this?” I asked him once, eyes on the dark. “You could be hunting. Scavenging. Something more… active.”

He shrugged.

“I sleep bad,” he said. “Might as well do it upright. Someone has to be awake while everyone else pretends they’re safe.”

“Why you?” I asked.

“Because I was already doing it before Rustfield,” he said. “City camps, freight yards, whatever needed someone with eyes that don’t wander. Hard to switch off.”

He glanced at my leg.

“Besides,” he added, “saves me from watching you limp around the camp trying to look useful. Up here, you’re actually useful.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I’ll mark that down as a compliment.”

“It was,” he said. “Don’t get used to it.”

Two months in, Else finally cut the rest of the cast away.

My leg looked wrong without it. Thinner. The skin pale where it hadn’t seen light. Muscles roped tight from underuse.

“Walk,” she ordered.

I did.

Carefully, at first. Heel, ball, toes. The bones complained. The tendons pulled. But nothing snapped. Every step felt more like mine.

“You still limp for while,” she said. “But you won’t break if you sneeze. You keep stretching. You don’t go running after anything bigger than a rabbit.”

“Define ‘running,’” I said.

“Faster than me,” she said. “That’s running.”

Outside, the air had shifted toward a less murderous cold. Not spring yet. Just a slightly less sharp version of winter.

I found Enzo near the butcher’s corner, arguing about cuts with Gretel like they were haggling over a car instead of a carcass.

I almost turned away.

Instead, I forced my feet to carry me closer.

“Enzo,” I said.

He glanced over, took in the uncovered leg, the careful step.

“You’re walking,” he said.

“Trying to,” I said. “Else says I can graduate to ‘idiot on two feet’ as long as I don’t sprint.”

“High bar,” he said.

We stood there for a second, the noise of the camp moving around us.

“I… said some shit,” I managed finally. “At the table. About settling. And clerks. And… you know what I said.”

“I do,” he said.

“I was angry about my own crap,” I said. “Didn’t mean to throw it at you. Or at what you do here. You’re the reason I’m not dead in a ditch right now. So—” I swallowed. “I’m sorry.”

He studied me for a long moment.

“‘Crippled clerk,’” he quoted.

“Yeah,” I said. “That one’s been echoing in my skull too.”

He let out a slow breath.

“You know what the worst part was?” he asked. “It’s not that you were wrong about being stuck. It’s that you said it like everyone who stays is… less. Like it’s easy.”

“I know it’s not,” I said quietly. “Karl stayed. You stay. I just—” I groped for the words. “Sometimes I think if I stop moving, I’ll turn into the walls I left.”

He huffed, just once.

“You won’t,” he said. “You don’t shut up long enough.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I think.”

He shrugged, some of the stiffness easing out of his shoulders.

“Forget it,” he said. “You were on drugs and in pain. Everyone says stupid things when they’re not sure their body still works.”

“I’ve said stupid things fully sober too,” I pointed out.

“I’ve noticed,” he said. “Means I’ll get more chances to be disappointed. Keeps life interesting.”

“If you need more material, I can start talking about moose again,” I said.

“Don’t,” he said. But there was a small smile now. “You come hunting again when Else says yes. Until then, you keep doing your clever map shit. Someone has to tell us where we’ve already almost died.”

“That I can do,” I said.

He clapped a hand on my shoulder, just once, then turned back to Gretel and whatever argument they’d paused.

I stood there a second longer, feeling the weight of his hand like another piece of cast that had just come off.

Two months ago, I’d limped back into Rustfield half-conscious and one stupid shift away from being dead under a moose.

Now I could walk the lanes without wood under my arms. People nodded when they passed. Jonas shouted something from the wall about me owing him a quiet shift. Helmut waved me over like the crate next to him had always had my name on it.

I still didn’t know how long I’d stay.

But for the first time since leaving Berlin, the idea of staying and the idea of leaving both felt like choices instead of accidents.

And that, in this world, was more than most people got.

Hunting alone felt like walking without skin.

Ever since Rustfield took me in, there had always been another set of footsteps in the snow. Mine and Enzo’s. Or mine and some other poor bastard on rotation. Another breath next to mine. Another voice complaining about the cold, or ammo, or how “this place smells like old socks and wet dog, Colt, I swear.”

Now it was just me.

The people on watch at the wall weren’t soldiers. No helmets, no armor plates, no mirrored visors. Just worn jackets, patchwork scarves, rifles that had changed hands too many times. I hadn’t seen a real uniform in over a year—not since Berlin. That was part of why Rustfield had felt… bearable. Less like a cage, more like a place people were trying to hold together with what they had.

I slipped out through the narrow gate, boot scraping over the threshold. The guy on watch—kid, really, younger than me by a couple of years—gave me a quick nod without standing up from his crate.

“Bring something back,” he said around a half-frozen cigarette. “And don’t get dead.”

“Trying not to,” I muttered.

The gate thunked shut behind me. Sound changed with it. The murmur of voices and metal-on-metal dulled to a low, distant hum. Out here, it was mostly wind and my own footsteps.

The valley stretched out in scabbed-over patches of snow and dead grass. Old roads cut through at weird angles, asphalt broken and buckled, lane markings long gone. A burned-out car sat half-buried in a drift like something trying to crawl out of its own grave.

I adjusted the rifle strap on my shoulder and headed toward the tree line.

The cold had teeth today. It bit through the seams of my coat, found the thin places, went to work. My leg—the one the moose had tried to turn into modern art—ached in a dull, familiar way. Not sharp enough to slow me. Just enough to make sure I remembered.

The quiet felt wrong.

On decent days, there was always *something*: a crow yelling at nothing, a rabbit making a bad decision across open ground, the creak of a branch with too much snow on it. Today I could hear the fabric of my coat brush when I moved my arms, the rasp of my breath inside my scarf, and not much else.

“You’re being jumpy,” I told myself under my breath. “It’s winter. Animals sleep, remember? That’s a thing.”

Didn’t help much.

At the edge of the trees, I crouched and studied the ground. Old tracks mostly. Human boot-tread from patrols and scavenging runs. The narrow, hopping marks of a hare that had come through… days ago, maybe. Hard to tell. The snow had that crusted, wind-smoothed look.

I pushed into the trees anyway.

They weren’t proper forest trees, like in the books. Too thin, too far apart. Black trunks, bare branches, bark peeling here and there where people had stripped it for kindling. The snow muffled everything, turning my steps into dull crunches.

Twenty minutes in, I found the first wrong thing.

Half a hare.

Back end only, lying in the snow with its spine snapped clean, guts spilled out and frozen mid-splash. The front half wasn’t anywhere. No scatter of fur. No blood trail. Just… gone.

I stared at it longer than I should’ve.

A fox would’ve left tracks, at least a sign of a struggle. A bird would’ve left a mess. This looked like something had just picked up the front half and removed it from reality.

“Could’ve been a while,” I muttered. “Wind erases tracks. That’s normal.”

Normal. Sure.

I stepped around it and kept going.

The quiet pressed in harder. Once, something shifted under the snow off to my right, then went still. A branch creaked overhead, slow and complaining. That was it.

I started watching the trees more than the ground. Looking for broken branches, stripped bark, anything to prove the world still had moving parts.

Found it a little later: claw marks on a trunk.

Four deep grooves, sliding down the wood from just above my shoulder height. The bark was fresh-peeled, pale underneath, sap frozen in little glassy beads.

“Boar?” I whispered. “Maybe.”

I pressed my gloved hand into one of the grooves without really thinking about it.

My fingers disappeared almost to the knuckle.

I pulled my hand back, flexing it like that would shake the feeling off.

Turning back crossed my mind in a real way for the first time. Walking straight back to Rustfield, finding Mira, saying: *“Forest feels wrong. Hunting’s a bad idea today.”*

I could already hear the answer, though. *“Forest always feels wrong, Colt. We still need to eat.”*

So I kept going.

The light dimmed by degrees. Winter afternoons didn’t linger. The sky slid from bright grey to dirty steel. My breath hung in front of me longer. The tips of my fingers prickled inside my gloves.

Then I found what I’d been looking for.

Hoof tracks. Fresh.

Sharp-edged marks cutting across a slope, snow still soft around them. Small, paired—not a moose, thank God. Roe deer, probably.

My chest loosened a fraction.

“About time,” I muttered.

I followed, moving slower now. The prints looped and meandered, stopping here and there where the animal had pawed at the snow to reach something edible.

The forest felt… less dead in that direction. Subtle things: the way the wind moved differently through the branches, the faint sound of something shifting weight ahead.

I heard the deer before I saw it. Soft scrapes, the careful crunch of hooves.

I crawled the last few meters up a small rise and eased myself behind a tangle of roots and dead brush. From there I could see into a shallow hollow.

One roe deer, head down, scraping at the snow with a front hoof. Thin, but not skeletal. Steam puffed from its nostrils with each breath.

No others. Just that one, alone in the hollow like a misplaced thought.

I slid the rifle off my shoulder, movements slow and automatic. Stock to shoulder. Cheek to wood. The world narrowed until it was the animal’s chest, the beat between my breaths, the weight of my finger on the trigger.

Breath in. The air burned going down.

Breath out. On the pause at the bottom, I squeezed.

The gunshot punched a hole in the quiet. Birds exploded up out of some distant clump of branches, wings flapping frantically. The recoil nudged into my shoulder, familiar.

The deer jerked, stumbled sideways, legs kicking once before folding. It hit the snow and went still except for the steam rising from its body.

I waited, counting heartbeats, keeping the sights on it.

No movement. No struggle.

I lowered the rifle and made my way down, boots sliding a little on the slope.

Up close, it looked smaller than through the sights. Younger, maybe. Its eye caught a bit of light, glassy and blank.

“Sorry,” I said quietly. Not sure who I was apologizing to. “Wrong place, wrong time.”

My knife hand knew what to do. Cut here. Open there. Let the heat escape. Steam rolled up past my face, carrying that copper-thick smell of blood and gut that my brain still labeled as *wrong* even after a year outside.

My stomach clenched once, then settled. The first time I’d done this, I’d thrown up behind Karl’s barn. Now it was just another necessary job.

When I’d done enough to get the weight manageable, I wrapped what I could in an old tarp, looped the rope around the hind legs, and started hauling.

Dragging deer over broken ground wasn’t elegant work. The carcass caught on roots and rocks and whatever the snow was hiding. Every jerk of the rope sent a flare of complaint through my once-broken leg.

By the time I cleared the trees, my lungs burned and my shoulders felt like someone had been beating on them from the inside.

The sky was going dark properly now. Not the soft movie kind of twilight—just the light draining out, leaving everything flat and hard-edged. Clouds smeared low. No stars yet. The air had that hollow sound that meant the temperature was about to drop harder.

Rustfield should’ve been making its little glow on the horizon. A soft smudge where fires and scrap-lamps blurred together behind the walls.

It wasn’t.

I crested the low ridge that overlooked the valley and stopped dead.

Smoke.

Not the thin, wandering thread of a cooking fire. A thick column, rising black at the base and dirty orange near the top. It twisted as it went up, lit from below like someone had shoved a piece of the sun into the valley floor.

Wrong spot. Wrong shape. Wrong everything.

I let go of the rope without realizing. The deer slid a little, bumping my heel.

For half a second my brain tried to file it as *old factory,* *burning dump,* anything but what it clearly was.

The wind shifted.

The smell hit.

Burning wood, burning plastic, burning… other things. A greasy, heavy stink that sat on the back of my tongue and wouldn’t move.

My heart started going too fast.

“No,” I said out loud. It sounded like somebody else. “No, no, no…”

Thoughts came in flashes, not full sentences. *They’ll have it under control. Small fire. Mistake in the kitchen. They’ve got barrels of water. It’s fine.*

The part of me that had gotten used to this world already knew better.

I ran.

The rifle thumped against my back, barrel smacking my shoulder blade with every uneven stride. Cold air tore down my throat. Pain jabbed up my bad leg with each footfall; I ignored it.

The closer I got, the worse the sky looked. The column of smoke broadened, spread out, turned into a dirty, glowing lid over where the camp should be. The orange underneath flickered and pulsed.

The edge of the walls came into view in jagged pieces through the murk.

Then I saw the hole.

A whole section of the west wall wasn’t a wall anymore.

Logs had been snapped, thrown inward and outward. Some lay in splintered chunks. Others stuck out at angles, half-buried in the torn-up ground. The metal sheets people had bolted on as extra reinforcement were peeled back and twisted, edges curled.

Something big had gone through. Not climbed. Not slipped. *Gone through.*

The earth in front of the breach was chewed up—deep gouges, churned mud, dirty snow trampled into a stained slurry. Like the ground had tried to resist and failed.

Heat rolled out of the opening, hit my face, made my eyes water even before the smoke did.

I slowed. My body didn’t want to go the last few meters. Some stupid, animal part of me understood that once I stepped through, there was no pretending it was just a bad dream I’d wake up from.

I stepped through.

It felt like walking into the inside of someone’s lungs.

Fire licked along tarps and wooden frames, crawling sideways in places, climbing up in others. Containers were on their sides, doors ripped open or caved in. Some were just black shells now. Sparks drifted everywhere, landing on my coat, fizzling out.

Smoke hugged the ground in pockets, thick and low. It hid things until I was almost on top of them.

The first body I nearly stepped on.

Black boots. Jeans burned off at the knees. What was left from there up was… more charcoal than person. Fused to a sheet of metal that had once been part of a wall.

The smell coming off it hit hard enough to make my stomach flip. Fat, meat, hair, plastic. Sweet and sick and impossible to ignore.

My foot skidded in something wet and slick. I didn’t look down. Couldn’t.

“Jonas!” I shouted, voice cracking. “Mira!”

The fire ate most of the sound. Somewhere off to my left, something structural collapsed with a bang and a shower of sparks.

Rustfield had always been noisy. Even when people were tired. Someone arguing about ration shares. Kids crying. Jonas bitching about standing shifts. Enzo singing badly to himself under his breath.

Now it was mostly fire and the pops of things giving up.

I moved without really deciding where I was going. Just following lanes I knew by habit, brain insisting on checking places where people usually were.

The butcher’s corner was just… gone. The hooks that had held up carcasses were bent and twisted. The roof had caved in. There was a hand sticking out from under a chunk of corrugated metal, fingers stiff, palm up. I didn’t check whose.

“Enzo!” I shouted. My voice went higher than I liked. “Enzo!”

No answer.

I turned into the main lane and stopped so abruptly my legs almost went out from under me.

Jason.

Face-up in the middle of the path.

I knew it was him because of the jacket. He loved that stupid jacket. Brown, with the cartoon pig patch on the arm that he’d insisted was “lucky.” The patch was half melted, smeared across burned fabric.

Everything from his ribs up was mostly intact. Soot smeared across one cheek. Mouth slightly open. Eyes wide, glazed, staring at the sky like there was something up there worth seeing.

From the ribs down… he wasn’t attached anymore.

His lower half lay crumpled against a wall a few meters away, twisted at the waist. One boot was gone. The other was still on, laces burned off, sole blackened.

Between the halves, the lane was a dark, irregular smear. Blood, probably. It didn’t look like anything I’d ever seen inside a human body. Just a mess.

The idea of *Jason*—the guy who cheated at cards and complained about onion in everything and laughed too loud—did not match the… pieces.

My brain tried to check out for a second. The edges of my vision fuzzed.

I sucked in air too fast. It tasted like ash and copper. I coughed, eyes burning, lungs protesting.

Move.

I didn’t know if that was my own voice or Karl’s echoing through memory. Didn’t matter. I forced my feet to go around Jason. Not through him. Around.

“Else!” I yelled, because if Jason was here, she had to be somewhere. “Else! Enzo!”

A sound answered, thin and ugly.

Not a word. A wet, rattling cough.

I followed it down a side lane, almost slipping where something red had frozen and thawed and frozen again.

She was propped against a low brick wall, not far from where she usually stood leaning on it, talking shit about everyone and everything.

It took me a second to recognize her.

Else’s face was grey under the soot, all the color sucked out. Her hair was plastered to her forehead, streaked dark with sweat and smoke. Her eyes didn’t look like they usually did—too big, too bright, like the pupils were trying to swallow the rest.

Her right leg was just… gone.

Above the knee, there was a stump. Someone had tied something around it—looked like a shirt and a belt together, pulled so tight the fabric cut into the skin. It was soaked through, dark and shiny. Blood had run down and dried in thick clots. It was still leaking in slow, ugly pulses.

I dropped to my knees in front of her. My bad leg sent a lightning bolt of pain up my thigh. I barely felt it.

“Else,” I said. My voice sounded small. Wrong. “Hey. Hey, I’m here.”

Her head rolled a little toward the sound, like it was too heavy. Her eyes struggled to focus on my face.

For half a heartbeat I hoped she wouldn’t recognize me. That I’d be just some blurred shape, not anyone she could put a name on.

Her mouth twitched.

“Where…” The word came out shredded, half-soaked in blood. She coughed, a horrible bubbling sound, then forced the rest out. “…the fuck… were you…”

It hit harder than any slap.

I opened my mouth. Nothing came out.

I had answers: *Outside. Hunting. Doing what I was told.* They all sounded like excuses, even inside my own head.

“I…” My tongue felt thick. “I was out. I didn’t know. Else, I—”

Another cough tore through her. More blood. It sheeted out of the corner of her mouth, ran toward her ear. She tried to lift a hand to wipe it away and her arm trembled uselessly.

On reflex, I grabbed her hand. It felt cold. Too light.

Her fingers curled around mine, weak but insistent.

“Too…” She swallowed, eyes flicking away from my face to some point over my shoulder. “…late…”

Her hand clenched once, surprisingly hard. Nails bit into my skin through the glove.

Then her whole body jerked. Once. Her chest hitched.

The breath went out of her in a long, uneven sigh.

Another one didn’t come.

Her grip loosened. Her head sagged sideways. Her eyes stayed open, pupils blown wide, staring at nothing.

I sat there with her hand in mine a few seconds longer, like letting go was some kind of final admission.

*Do something,* my brain kept insisting. *Stop the bleeding. Drag her somewhere. Call for—*

There was no “somewhere.” No one to call for. Nothing left to stop.

I let her hand slip out of mine. The fingers flopped to the ground, palm up.

My gloves were smeared red. I wiped them on my coat without looking.

Something shifted inside my chest. Not a crack, exactly. More like the floor dropping a few centimeters without warning.

This was the first time someone had died *in front of me.* Not behind a wall. Not as a story. Not as a rumor that went around the mess line.

Else had looked at me, asked where the fuck I’d been, and then… stopped.

I pushed myself back up. My legs felt weird, like they didn’t quite belong to me.

The camp blurred into a mess of firelight and shadow. Shapes that might be bodies, might be debris. The air roared in my ears. My own heartbeat was too loud.

Some part of me was still hunting. Looking for familiar faces in the chaos. Maybe if I found someone alive, anything would make more sense.

The main square was where my feet took me.

It was or had been Rustfield’s heart. The place with the oil drums and the trading tables and that dumb string of colored plastic Enzo had once insisted on hanging up because “it makes this shithole look *less* like a grave, Colt.”

Now it looked like the center of an explosion someone had paused halfway through.

The ground was split. Cracks ran through the old concrete, some wide enough to swallow my foot. A couple of the oil drums lay on their sides, fire licking out of them. The stumps of posts where tarps had been strung were snapped.

And in the middle of it all lay the thing that had done this.

For a second, my brain refused to parse it. It was just a pile of twisted something. Metal? Concrete?

Then an arm resolved out of the mess. Big. Longer than I was tall. Muscles in the wrong places, skin scorched and torn. The hand at the end of it had too many joints, fingers bent back at angles that looked painful even in death.

Once I saw one arm, I couldn’t stop seeing the rest.

Arms everywhere. Dozens. Some thick and roped with sinew. Some thin and whip-like. Some ending in hands, some in blunt, bony clubs, some tapering into nothing, fusing back into the main body as if they hadn’t quite finished growing.

The torso was a ruined mountain of flesh and bone, hunched and swollen. Parts of it were burned down to something that looked like black glass. Other parts glistened wet and raw.

The head… I guessed it was the head… was smashed into the ground at a breakneck angle. Jaw wrenched open, teeth bared, skull cracked in a web of fractures. One eye socket was just a crater filled with blood and sticky, blackened jelly.

The smell rolling off it was thick enough to taste. Rot, chemicals, blood, something sour and wrong underneath it all.

Bullet wounds pocked its hide in clusters. Chunks were blown out along one side where explosives had bitten in. One massive arm was driven straight through its own chest, punching into the broken concrete below, pinning it there like a grotesque tent peg.

I took a step forward without meaning to. The heat coming off the carcass hit the front of my body.

Mutant.

Not a drawing on a warning poster. Not Karl’s rough sketches on old paper. Not rumors about “things in the dark” whispered over stew.

A dead, real one. In the center of what used to be a home.

Next to its shattered head, slumped against the torn flesh like he was just taking a rest, sat Enzo.

For a heartbeat, I didn’t recognize him. The pose was almost casual. Legs splayed, shoulders against the meat of the thing, head tilted forward.

Then my eyes caught his jacket. The one with the faded tricolor patch on the sleeve. The same one he always complained was “too thin for this bullshit climate” and refused to replace.

His chest was soaked. Dark. Stiff. Whatever had hit him had done it hard and deep. The front of his coat looked like someone had tried to paint it red with a bucket and bad aim.

One arm lay limp at his side, fingers open, palm up. The other was raised, elbow on his knee. His hand was clenched around the handle of a knife.

The knife was buried to the hilt in the mutant’s ruined eye socket.

The skin around it was cracked and blackened, like whatever he’d put on the blade had burned when it went in.

I stopped a meter away. Couldn’t go closer. Couldn’t step back.

My brain started throwing up fragments.

Enzo grumbling about the way I cleaned rifles. Enzo laughing when I slipped on ice and pretended I’d done it on purpose. Enzo pushing the last piece of rabbit toward me because I was “still too thin, city boy.”

Enzo’s hand wrapped around this knife, putting it exactly where it needed to go.

His eyes were half open now. Whatever they’d been looking at last, it wasn’t here anymore.

My knees gave out more than I decided to kneel.

The ground was hot where mutant blood had soaked through the cracks. It seeped around the fabric of my pants, sticky and wrong.

“How…” I heard myself say. The word came out thin and high. “How the fuck…”

The forest clicked into place in my head. The half-eaten hare. The claw marks. The dead quiet. The way every part of me had wanted to turn back without knowing why.

I’d spent the afternoon tracking one skinny deer while *this* thing had been heading straight for Rustfield.

While everyone here had been fighting and screaming and dying under it, I’d been a ridge away, cutting meat and cursing at roots that caught my rope.

The guilt didn’t seep in. It slammed.

Air got hard to pull in. My chest worked, but the breaths came short and fast, not doing anything. My fingers started tingling. My face felt hot and numb at the same time.

*If you’d gone back sooner.*  

If I’d listened to that instinct and turned around the moment the forest felt wrong. If I’d dropped the hunt and run home. If I’d been on the wall with a rifle when the first scream went up. Maybe I still would’ve died. Maybe I wouldn’t have changed a damn thing.

Didn’t matter.

All I could hear was Else’s voice: *Where the fuck were you…*

I swallowed. It hurt.

“I was out there,” I said, because saying nothing felt worse. My voice shook. “You were here and I was out there.”

Enzo didn’t answer, obviously. The mutant didn’t move. The fire crackled and hissed and ate.

My hand moved on its own, reaching out to touch his sleeve. The fabric was stiff with dried blood. Still warm underneath.

I curled my fingers around his wrist.

Nothing. No pulse. Just the weight of his arm, the dead slackness in the tendons.

I let go. My hand shook when I pulled it back.

I wanted to scream. To punch something. To collapse. To rewind time by a few hours and do everything differently.

None of that happened.

Instead, I just knelt there on the cracked concrete next to Enzo and the dead mutant, hands hanging uselessly between my knees, breath coming too fast and not deep enough, eyes stinging.

Smoke drifted low, stinging my nose, making the ash and the snow look the same where they settled on the ground.

Three months ago, the worst thing I’d seen up close was a broken nose in a ration fight.

Now I knew what it looked like when a person came apart in two different places. I knew what it sounded like when someone died angry at me. I knew what it smelled like when a whole camp lost.

And somewhere under the shock and the static and the smoke, one thought dug in and refused to move:

*You weren’t here when it happened.*

I didn’t cry.

I didn’t move.

I just stayed there, heat baking one side of my face, cold clawing at the other, and tried to understand how a single day could turn everything I’d started to build into a burning pile of meat and metal.

Whatever story I thought I was in when I’d walked past Berlin’s walls, this was the one I had now.

And for the moment, I was still breathing in it.
