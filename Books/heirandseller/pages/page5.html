<p>Ash tapped the glass like it was a dog she wanted to pet.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“You got good taste... Haven´t seen this baby before..”</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro nodded politely.</p>
<p>Haru on the other hand looked like he might faint from how much he just had to</p>
<p>remember.</p>
<p>Ash said suddenly</p>
<p>{{ash|“Why the hell’d you give ’em such boring science names tho? Your versions</p>
<p>sound cooler.”}}</p>
<p>Tanishiro replied</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Scientific names for paperwork. Real names for people with spirit.”</span></p>
<p>Ash snickered.</p>
<p>He gestured for her to follow him deeper inside.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Before we discuss business..”</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro said</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“I wonder... would you like to visit the casino floor? It was recently renovated. Or perhaps... something else in the tower? My son can arrange anything for you, Ash-san.”</span></p>
<p>Ash leaned back, hands on her hips.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Mmm. Maybe after work. Maybe after I bully your kid a little more-”</span></p>
<p>She flinched at Haru jokingly and haru jumped and backed off slightly with a squeak that resembled a tea kettle.</p>
