<p>Haru cleared his throat, trying to maintain composure.</p>
<p>“They, ah... have not seen someone like you before.”</p>
<p>Ash met most people´s gazes.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Mm.. I get that a lot.”</span></p>
<p>As they walked, Haru tried to fill the silence.</p>
<p>“So, Miss Ash... have you visited Tokyo many times before?”</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Oh yeah..”</span></p>
<p>she said, stretching some more.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Your food slaps harder than a hispanic mother. I come here when I’m bored quite often.”</span></p>
<p>“A-Ah... wonderful!”</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“And your dad’s lil’ tiltrotor surprise? Sweet of him.”</span></p>
<p>Haru almost tripped.</p>
<p>“He... he will be glad you liked it.”</p>
<p>When they reached a broad lacquered door, Haru slid it open for Ash.</p>
<p>The hallway got filled with the warm scent of tatami, sandalwood, and expensive incense.</p>
<p>Inside stood Tanishiro <em>himself.</em></p>
<p>He is tall and handsome, figures, looking young as ever.</p>
<p>There are some dyed jade stripes in his hair and he wears a light gray kimono over a green vest. Along with Jade jewelery.</p>
