<p>Ash shrugged.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“No prob. That’ll be 300 bucks.”</span></p>
<p>He laughed again as they stepped onto a wooden viewing platform overlooking the city.</p>
<p>Ash leaned on the railing with her cigarette dangling in her fingers. The hair tie in her hair was swaying back and forth.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“So what now, Tani?”</span></p>
<p>she asked.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Whatchu got planned? Fancy view, fancy cigarettes… am I about to be seduced or stabbed?”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“No, No. None of that. I just look forward to our business more than I should. This is our fourth successful deal. And I suspect it will not be the last.”</span></p>
<p>Ash joked.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Mmmmmm. You know how to talk dirty to me.”</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro closed his eyes for a moment and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Why do I try...”</span></p>
<p>he muttered.</p>
<p>She blew a small smoke ring to prove his point.</p>
