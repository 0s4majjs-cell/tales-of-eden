<p>They continued walking.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Tell me something, honestly, Ash-san.”</span></p>

<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“My son... the young man who escorted you earlier...”</span></p>
<p>Ash snorted so hard smoke came out her nose.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“HAHAHAHA THAT LITTLE GUY?”</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro covered his mouth politely.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Yes. Him.”</span></p>
<p>Ash took another drag, then shrugged.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“He’s cute. Anxious as fuck tho.”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“...I see.”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“But he’s polite... Respectful..-and Didn’t piss himself. That’s a plus.”</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro hummed.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“I wonder... do you believe he can one day handle real responsibility? He wishes to take part in my business eventually.”</span></p>
<p>Ash blew a slow smoke ring, before setting into a slightly more serious tone, yet still laced with a nonchalant edge.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Tani. Listen to me carefully.”</span></p>
<p>She flicked ash onto the stony walkway.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“That boy? Right now he’s softer than mochi. Softer than my tits. Softer than a fuckin’ marshmallow floating in a hot spring.”</span></p>
