<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Very sweet of you, Tani.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro’s smile deepened.</p>
<p>On the table behind him lay three heirlooms, each sealed in glass cases, resting on dark velvet.</p>

<p>He continued</p>
<p>“Jinteki Resonant”</p>

<p>He continued again, the final one.</p>
<p>“Subtype 03”</p>
<p>“Simply... The Dancing Dragon Fuse. This one belongs to the Horyu Vault Records...”</p>
