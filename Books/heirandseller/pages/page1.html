<p>The tiltrotor blades roared above the smog tinted clouds as Ash lounged back in the seat, one leg over the other while with her phone pressed lazily into her ear.</p>
<p>“-No, no, listen-”</p>
<p>she toyed with her hair tie.</p>
<p>“-we could finish this on the call, but you’ll pitch it better when I’m in front of you.”</p>
<p>A warm and deep laugh crackled from the other side.</p>
<p>“You always preferred looking a man in the eyes when he wants something from you, miss Ash.”</p>
<p>Ash grinned.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“´Xactly...”</span></p>
<p>Another laugh.</p>
<p>“Then I will see you in person. We will speak properly here.”</p>
<p>He hung up just as the tiltrotor banked left, revealing Tokyo Safe Zone through the window and Ash could not help but soft up for a second.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Hah… forgot how fuckin’ tasty this place smells,”</span></p>
<p>she mumbled to herself, breath fogging faintly on the glass as the tiltrotor sat down on the helipad.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Gonna get me some damn fine dumplings-”</span></p>
<p>The door suddenly slid open and came a voice.</p>
<p>“-E-EXCUSE ME ! Miss Ash?”</p>
