<p>After walking for a bit they reached the garden halls</p>
<p>They shimmered with lantern lights as they walked and koi carps flicked beneath the glass floor along with blossoms floating down from an actual organic plum tree overhead.</p>
<p>Ash, meanwhile, was half skipping and stomping randomly to scare the little koi.</p>
<p>Tanishiro let out a chuckle that was more of a breath.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“You are... Very <em>spirited</em> today, I noticed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“As per usual. It’s a medical condition...”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Really now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Ha. <em>Nope.</em>”</span></p>
<p>They stepped into a quieter part of the garden, shaded by a large curved bridge.</p>
<p>Tanishiro reached into his coat and produced a slim wooden case.</p>
<p>He offered it to her.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Ash-san. A little something.”</span></p>
<p>Ash immediately got excited.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Oooh?? Gifts?! For me?! <em>Shit,</em> Tanishiro, you’re speakin’ my language!”</span></p>
<p>He opened the case.</p>
<p>Inside were long, intricately wrapped cigarettes.</p>
<p>Silk filters.. Silver threaded paper... Faintly perfumed, too.</p>
