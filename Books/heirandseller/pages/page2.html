<p>A young man stood at the doorway of the aircraft. He was bowing so fast his glasses nearly slid off and his accent was soft and polite, but he looked nervous.</p>
<p>Ash snickered and then began speaking.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Well helloooo cutie... You the welcoming committee?”</span></p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>he squeaked.</p>
<p>“I am Tanishiro-sama’s son, Haru. I was instructed to escort you personally tto-”</p>
<p>Ash stood up, towering over him while stretching lazily.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Oooh.. The boss’s boy, huh? No pressure.”</span></p>
<p>She ruffled his hair.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Then you’re new, right?”</span></p>
<p>He reddened instantly like a tomato.</p>
<p>“H-How do you kno-”</p>
<p>Ash cut him off.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“C’mon, lets get to walking, you might get a treat if you do well...”</span></p>
<p>She winked at him.</p>
<p>Haru nodded rapidly and led her toward the private terminal.</p>
<p>As soon as Ash stepped into the hallway, people moved out of her way while she just kept walking straight without a bother. Some whispered and constantly looked all over her.</p>
