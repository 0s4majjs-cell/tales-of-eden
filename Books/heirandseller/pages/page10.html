<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“I feared as much.”</span></p>

<p>she continued, pointing the cigarette at him like a tiny staff</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Soft ain’t always bad. Means he ain’t ripe yet.”</span></p>

<p>Ash grinned, leaning in close.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Oh, he can toughen up. Throw him into some sketchy shit, let him fail, let him taste the real deal a little... Maybe let me scare him again for fun... Hehe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“You enjoyed that far too much.”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Yeahhh I love bullying men who have the emotional fortitude of whipped cream.”</span></p>

<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“he’s got a good heart. You can’t teach that, especially in today´s era. And he looks at you like you’re some legendary wuxia hero.”</span></p>
<p>Tanishiro paused in the middle of a step.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“..Does he?”</span></p>
