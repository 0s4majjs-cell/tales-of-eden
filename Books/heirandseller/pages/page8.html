<p>Tanishiro took one and tapped it lightly.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Hand rolled with infused tobacco... About... a hundred fifty credits each..”</span></p>
<p>Ash was lightly stunned.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“ONE FIFTY PER A CIGGIE?!”</span></p>
<p>He nodded calmly.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“That is the going rate...”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Holy SHIT! If someone dropped one of these I’d BEAT THEIR ASS! Gimme.”</span></p>
<p>He handed her one and produced a silver lighter. The flame danced.</p>
<p>Ash leaned in with the cigarette between her lips.</p>
<p>Tanishiro lit it for her with a simple motion.</p>
<p>Ash exhaled a long cloud of fragrant smoke.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“…oh my gooohd...”</span></p>

<p>Tanishiro asked.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“This is the smoothest smoke I’ve ever had... Geez..! Now I know what kind of shit you smoke Tani!”</span></p>
<p>He laughed out lightly, trying to hold the laughter in.</p>
<p>She elbowed him.</p>
<p><span class="tone tone-ash">“Don’t hold your giggles Tani let ‘em out. I know I’m fucking hilarious.”</span></p>
<p><span class="tone tone-tanishiro">“Indeed you are.”</span></p>
<p>he said with a small bow of his head.</p>
