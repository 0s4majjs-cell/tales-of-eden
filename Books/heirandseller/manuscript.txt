# The Heir and Seller

The tiltrotor blades roared above the smog tinted clouds as Ash lounged back in the seat, one leg over the other while with her phone pressed lazily into her ear.

“-No, no, listen-” 
she toyed with her hair tie. 
“-we could finish this on the call, but you’ll pitch it better when I’m in front of you.”
A warm and deep laugh crackled from the other side.

“You always preferred looking a man in the eyes when he wants something from you, miss Ash.”

Ash grinned.
{{ash|“´Xactly...”}}

Another laugh.
“Then I will see you in person. We will speak properly here.”
He hung up just as the tiltrotor banked left, revealing Tokyo Safe Zone through the window and Ash could not help but soft up for a second.
{{ash|“Hah… forgot how fuckin’ tasty this place smells,”}}
she mumbled to herself, breath fogging faintly on the glass as the tiltrotor sat down on the helipad.
{{ash|“Gonna get me some damn fine dumplings-”}}

The door suddenly slid open and came a voice.

“-E-EXCUSE ME ! Miss Ash?”

A young man stood at the doorway of the aircraft. He was bowing so fast his glasses nearly slid off and his accent was soft and polite, but he looked nervous.

Ash snickered and then began speaking.

{{ash|“Well helloooo cutie... You the welcoming committee?”}}

“Yes!”

he squeaked.
“I am Tanishiro-sama’s son, Haru. I was instructed to escort you personally tto-”

Ash stood up, towering over him while stretching lazily.

{{ash|“Oooh.. The boss’s boy, huh? No pressure.”}}

She ruffled his hair.

{{ash|“Then you’re new, right?”}}

He reddened instantly like a tomato.

“H-How do you kno-”

Ash cut him off.

{{ash|“C’mon, lets get to walking, you might get a treat if you do well...”}}

She winked at him.

Haru nodded rapidly and led her toward the private terminal.

As soon as Ash stepped into the hallway, people moved out of her way while she just kept walking straight without a bother. Some whispered and constantly looked all over her.

Haru cleared his throat, trying to maintain composure.
“They, ah... have not seen someone like you before.”

Ash met most people´s gazes.
{{ash|“Mm.. I get that a lot.”}}

As they walked, Haru tried to fill the silence.

“So, Miss Ash... have you visited Tokyo many times before?”

{{ash|“Oh yeah..”}}
she said, stretching some more.

{{ash|“Your food slaps harder than a hispanic mother. I come here when I’m bored quite often.”}}

“A-Ah... wonderful!”

{{ash|“And your dad’s lil’ tiltrotor surprise? Sweet of him.”}}

Haru almost tripped.
“He... he will be glad you liked it.”

When they reached a broad lacquered door, Haru slid it open for Ash.

The hallway got filled with the warm scent of tatami, sandalwood, and expensive incense.

Inside stood Tanishiro *himself.*

He is tall and handsome, figures, looking young as ever.

There are some dyed jade stripes in his hair and he wears a light gray kimono over a green vest. Along with Jade jewelery.

{{Tanishiro|“Ash-san..”}}
He greeted with a respectful, slightly amused bow. 
{{Tanishiro|“How was the flight?”}}

Ash smirked.
{{ash|“Actually? Good. Didn’t expect the tiltrotor. Sweet move, really!”}}

“I hoped it would make your journey comfortable.”

She shrugged.
{{ash|“Very sweet of you, Tani."}}

Tanishiro’s smile deepened.

On the table behind him lay three heirlooms, each sealed in glass cases, resting on dark velvet.

Haru suddenly cleared his throat.
“Miss Ash, these are our proud treasures... Their scientific classifications are-uhare as follows”
He pointed and begain talking, all out of his memory.
“Pluto-enriched Trilith Core”

Haru added nervously
“This is a simple trilith core... as you wanted... With a slight enhancement.”
He continued
“Jinteki Resonant”
“Also known as Moon Steel.”
He continued again, the final one.
“Subtype 03”
“Simply... The Dancing Dragon Fuse. This one belongs to the Horyu Vault Records...”

Ash tapped the glass like it was a dog she wanted to pet.
{{ash|“You got good taste... Haven´t seen this baby before..”}}

Tanishiro nodded politely.
Haru on the other hand looked like he might faint from how much he just had to
remember.

Ash said suddenly
{{ash|“Why the hell’d you give ’em such boring science names tho? Your versions
sound cooler.”}}

Tanishiro replied
{{Tanishiro|“Scientific names for paperwork. Real names for people with spirit.”}}

Ash snickered.

He gestured for her to follow him deeper inside.
{{Tanishiro|“Before we discuss business..”}}
Tanishiro said
{{Tanishiro|“I wonder... would you like to visit the casino floor? It was recently renovated. Or perhaps... something else in the tower? My son can arrange anything for you, Ash-san.”}}

Ash leaned back, hands on her hips.
{{ash|“Mmm. Maybe after work. Maybe after I bully your kid a little more-”}}

She flinched at Haru jokingly and haru jumped and backed off slightly with a squeak that resembled a tea kettle.

Tanishiro laughed and then replied.
{{Tanishiro|“Come then..”}}
he added.
{{Tanishiro|“Walk with me.”}}

Tanishiro turned and looked at the two large massive men behind him.

They were geared in plated ballistic armor which had dragon motifs and reinforced helmets with slit visors.
These deffinitely were not some run of the mill rent-a-cops.

Tanishiro addressed them smoothly.
{{Tanishiro|“Transport all of our guest’s goods to the tiltrotor. The items she delivered, take them for inspection as well.”}}
The guards bowed silently and immediately moved out.
Ash let out an impressed whistle as Tanishiro led Ash out of the chamber, sliding open a door that led them into a hidden wing of the tower.

{{Tanishiro|“They are veterans of the Wuyun Conflict.”}}

Tanishiro replied.
{{Tanishiro|“Movements drilled into bone, truly.”}}
He turned smoothly and guided her forward.

Ash followed him while watching the kimono coat swish around his legs.
{{ash|“Mm... Fancy little army you have...”}}

After walking for a bit they reached the garden halls
They shimmered with lantern lights as they walked and koi carps flicked beneath the glass floor along with blossoms floating down from an actual organic plum tree overhead.

Ash, meanwhile, was half skipping and stomping randomly to scare the little koi.
Tanishiro let out a chuckle that was more of a breath.
{{Tanishiro|“You are... Very *spirited* today, I noticed.”}}

{{ash|“As per usual. It’s a medical condition...”}}

{{Tanishiro|“Really now?”}}

{{ash|“Ha. *Nope.*”}}

They stepped into a quieter part of the garden, shaded by a large curved bridge.
Tanishiro reached into his coat and produced a slim wooden case.

He offered it to her.

{{Tanishiro|“Ash-san. A little something.”}}

Ash immediately got excited.
{{ash|“Oooh?? Gifts?! For me?! *Shit,* Tanishiro, you’re speakin’ my language!”}}

He opened the case.

Inside were long, intricately wrapped cigarettes.
Silk filters.. Silver threaded paper... Faintly perfumed, too.

Tanishiro took one and tapped it lightly.
{{Tanishiro|“Hand rolled with infused tobacco... About... a hundred fifty credits each..”}}

Ash was lightly stunned.
{{ash|“ONE FIFTY PER A CIGGIE?!”}}

He nodded calmly.
{{Tanishiro|“That is the going rate...”}}

{{ash|“Holy SHIT! If someone dropped one of these I’d BEAT THEIR ASS! Gimme.”}}

He handed her one and produced a silver lighter. The flame danced.

Ash leaned in with the cigarette between her lips.

Tanishiro lit it for her with a simple motion.

Ash exhaled a long cloud of fragrant smoke.
{{ash|“…oh my gooohd...”}}

{{Tanishiro|“How is it?”}}

Tanishiro asked.
{{ash|“This is the smoothest smoke I’ve ever had... Geez..! Now I know what kind of shit you smoke Tani!”}}

He laughed out lightly, trying to hold the laughter in.

She elbowed him.
{{ash|“Don’t hold your giggles Tani let ‘em out. I know I’m fucking hilarious.”}}

{{Tanishiro|“Indeed you are.”}}

he said with a small bow of his head.

They continued walking.
{{Tanishiro|“Tell me something, honestly, Ash-san.”}}

{{ash|“Shoot.”}}

{{Tanishiro|“My son... the young man who escorted you earlier...”}}

Ash snorted so hard smoke came out her nose.
{{ash|“HAHAHAHA THAT LITTLE GUY?”}}

Tanishiro covered his mouth politely.
{{Tanishiro|“Yes. Him.”}}

Ash took another drag, then shrugged.
{{ash|“He’s cute. Anxious as fuck tho.”}}

{{Tanishiro|“...I see.”}}

{{ash|“But he’s polite... Respectful..-and Didn’t piss himself. That’s a plus.”}}

Tanishiro hummed.
{{Tanishiro|“I wonder... do you believe he can one day handle real responsibility? He wishes to take part in my business eventually.”}}

Ash blew a slow smoke ring, before setting into a slightly more serious tone, yet still laced with a nonchalant edge.

{{ash|“Tani. Listen to me carefully.”}}
She flicked ash onto the stony walkway.

{{ash|“That boy? Right now he’s softer than mochi. Softer than my tits. Softer than a fuckin’ marshmallow floating in a hot spring.”}}

Tanishiro exhaled through his nose.
{{Tanishiro|“I feared as much.”}}

{{ash|“But-”}}
she continued, pointing the cigarette at him like a tiny staff
{{ash|“Soft ain’t always bad. Means he ain’t ripe yet.”}}

{{Tanishiro|“Mmh.. He would need to become stronger...”}}

Ash grinned, leaning in close.
{{ash|“Oh, he can toughen up. Throw him into some sketchy shit, let him fail, let him taste the real deal a little... Maybe let me scare him again for fun... Hehe.”}}

{{Tanishiro|“You enjoyed that far too much.”}}

{{ash|“Yeahhh I love bullying men who have the emotional fortitude of whipped cream.”}}

Tanishiro laughed and Ash smiled around her cigarette.

{{ash|“But here’s the thing..”}}
she added, tone dropping into something surprisingly real under the humor,
{{ash|“he’s got a good heart. You can’t teach that, especially in today´s era. And he looks at you like you’re some legendary wuxia hero.”}}

Tanishiro paused in the middle of a step.
{{Tanishiro|“..Does he?”}}

{{ash|“He atleast seems to admire the everloving shit out of you.”}}

Tanishiro’s expression softened

{{Tanishiro|“Ash-san... thank you. Truly.”}}

Ash shrugged.
{{ash|“No prob. That’ll be 300 bucks.”}}

He laughed again as they stepped onto a wooden viewing platform overlooking the city.

Ash leaned on the railing with her cigarette dangling in her fingers. The hair tie in her hair was swaying back and forth.
{{ash|“So what now, Tani?”}}
she asked.
{{ash|“Whatchu got planned? Fancy view, fancy cigarettes… am I about to be seduced or stabbed?”}}

{{Tanishiro|“No, No. None of that. I just look forward to our business more than I should. This is our fourth successful deal. And I suspect it will not be the last.”}}

Ash joked.
{{ash|“Mmmmmm. You know how to talk dirty to me.”}}

Tanishiro closed his eyes for a moment and pinched the bridge of his nose.
{{Tanishiro|“Why do I try...”}}
he muttered.

She blew a small smoke ring to prove his point.

But then his tone changed and he asked something out of the theme.
{{Tanishiro|“Will you ever tell me where you truly come from, Ash-san?”}}

Ash stared at him for half a second before chuckling.
{{ash|“OHHhhh Tani you do not wanna open that can of worms.”}}

{{Tanishiro|“I am.. Merely curious..”}}
he insisted gently.
{{Tanishiro|“You appear from nowhere and vanish for months. You handle operations that should take entire squads... and yet... You do not answer to any known syndicate.”}}

Ash shrugged it out.
{{ash|“Yeah, I’m mysterious as fuck i guess.”}}

{{ash|“I supposed so.”}}
he admitted with a tight exhale.

{{Tanishiro|“Still… one day, perhaps you will trust me enough to share-”}}
Before he could follow up, the deep groan of the tiltrotor blades rolled over the balcony.
The aircraft banked smoothly and positioned itself level with the balcony, several meters away from it though.

Tanishiro glanced at it, then at her.
{{Tanishiro|“I called it in early. I didn’t want to keep you too long.”}}

{{ash|“Mm. Spoiling me again.”}}
She tapped her cigarette out on the railing and stretched, as she did so he stepped back, hands
behind him.

{{Tanishiro|“Safe travels, Ash.”}}

She shot him a lazy salute with two finger and with zero run-up, she hopped onto the railing,
balanced for a half-second, and launched herself straight into the open tiltrotor cabin effortlessly.

She grabbed the safety rail, swung herself into a seat, and yelled toward the cockpit.
{{ash|“A’IGHT, LET’S GET MOVING! I’M STARVING AND I WANT NOODLES BEFORE I GO COMMIT MUTANT GENOCIDE IN THE WOODS!”}}

Tanishiro watched her go as the aircraft pulled away inbetween the buildings.
