<h2 class="chapter-title">The Burner</h2>
<p>Inactive, the Burner is almost nothing—just a faint shimmer in the air, a distortion like heat waves rising from sun-baked asphalt. It blends into the landscape so well that most people walk past it without ever knowing how close they came. Only at night, when the world dims and the contrast sharpens, or through the lens of specialized detectors, does the anomaly become easier to pick out.</p>
<p>Once triggered by a living being or an object entering its radius, the transformation is instant. The air inside the anomaly flashes to temperatures of up to 3000°C (5432°F), heat so intense it doesn’t burn so much as erase. Anything caught in that space is reduced to ash in a heartbeat. Metal hurled into a Burner will first glow white-hot, deform, and then crumble away—one of the only safe ways to test for its presence without stepping into oblivion.</p>
<p>Because of the extreme temperatures, some scavengers attempt to “farm” Burners, using their heat to fuse or refine rare materials. Few walk away unscathed. Even a moment of misjudgment can mean melted gear, fused armor, or the collapse of protective equipment, and the superheated air can cook flesh and bone long before a person understands what’s happening.</p>
