<h2 class="chapter-title">The Electro</h2>
<p>Electro anomalies tend to cluster around the relics of humanity’s old power—abandoned plants, ruined substations, derelict cities threaded with dead cables. They appear as a bluish haze or a shimmering knot of air, hanging low over the ground or coiling lazily between broken structures. In daylight, they can be picked out by their unnatural stillness; at night, they betray themselves with tiny blue sparks, a miniature storm trapped in place.</p>
<p>When disturbed, an Electro discharges violently, unleashing a storm of miniature lightning strikes in every direction. These bolts don’t just sting—they kill. The electrical surge is strong enough to stop a heart in an instant, cook nerves, and overload cybernetics or powered armor from the inside out. Even a “weak” discharge is often fatal at close range.</p>
<p>The anomaly is drawn to metal and active electronics, making anyone carrying weapons, tools, or advanced gear especially vulnerable. While many Electros can be avoided in clear daylight, in dark spaces, storms, or cramped ruins, they become far harder to see and far more deadly. Survivors often report hearing their last warning as a faint crackle—right before everything goes white.</p>
