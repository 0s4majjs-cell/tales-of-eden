<h2 class="chapter-title">The Whirligig</h2>
<p>A Whirligig announces itself with motion: a small, continuous whirlwind of dust, ash, and debris turning lazily above the ground. It looks weak, almost fragile, but the area around it tells the truth. Scattered equipment, torn clothing, and occasionally dismembered body parts lie strewn in its vicinity, grim evidence of what happens when the anomaly is triggered.</p>
<p>Once activated, the Whirligig becomes a concentrated vortex of violent air currents. Anything within its radius—stones, weapons, entire bodies—is snatched off the ground and dragged into a chaotic spin. Those caught near the fringes may be battered, thrown, or left with broken bones and lacerations. Those pulled toward the center face far worse. The forces involved can wrench limbs from sockets, tear bodies apart, and shred flesh against flying debris.</p>
<p>In open spaces, the Whirligig is terrifying enough. In enclosed environments—ruined buildings, tunnels, collapsed industrial sites—its lethality increases dramatically. With nowhere to escape and walls to ricochet off, victims are often flung repeatedly into hard surfaces until there is little left to recognize.</p>
