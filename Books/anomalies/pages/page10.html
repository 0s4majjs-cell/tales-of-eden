<h2 class="chapter-title">The Lift</h2>
<p>The Lift anomaly is a rare oddity in a world that mostly wants you dead. Unlike most of its counterparts, it does not directly maim or destroy on contact. It manifests as a patch of space where gravity weakens or vanishes altogether. To casual observation, it can be nearly invisible. Only the occasional floating leaf, drifting speck of dust, or slowly rising scrap of debris hints at the change. Step into its field, and the body grows light. Equipment tugs gently upward. A careless jump can send a person drifting into open air, flailing as the usual rules of weight and motion no longer apply. For a brief moment, the Lift can feel almost miraculous—a reprieve from the constant drag of fatigue and heavy gear. The danger lies not in the anomaly itself, but in what surrounds it. Objects that were previously pinned to the ground—rubble, scrap metal, broken beams—can be suspended overhead. When the anomaly collapses or changes phase without warning, everything it was holding aloft comes crashing down. Anyone trapped underneath becomes an easy target for falling debris, and rescuing them is often impossible in time. In hostile territory, a disabled scavenger pinned under a pile of rubble is simply prey waiting to be claimed.</p>
