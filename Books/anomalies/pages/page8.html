<h2 class="chapter-title">The Gascon</h2>
<p>Gascon anomalies are chemical nightmares—zones where the air itself becomes a weapon. In open terrain, they can usually be identified by thick, roiling mists and the glistening pools of corrosive liquid that bubble and spit at their feet. The air around them often carries a sharp, acidic stench that burns in the throat and nose, signaling danger even before visual confirmation.</p>
<p>The anomaly constantly generates toxic gases and highly corrosive acids. The liquid it produces can strip flesh from bone in seconds, leaving behind raw, eaten tissue and exposed skeleton. The gases are equally lethal, attacking the lungs and respiratory system, causing internal burns, suffocation, and rapid organ failure. Even brief exposure without proper protective gear can result in permanent damage or death.</p>
<p>In enclosed spaces—tunnels, bunkers, underground facilities—the Gascon becomes truly devastating. The fumes pool and spread rapidly, filling low places and creeping through cracks. Visibility drops, detectors can become unreliable, and a single misstep can plunge an unsuspecting explorer into a pocket of concentrated toxin. In such conditions, a Gascon can wipe out an entire group before they even understand what they’ve walked into.</p>
