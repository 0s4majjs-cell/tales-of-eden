<h2 class="chapter-title">Fruit Punch</h2>
<p>The anomaly known as Fruit Punch is small and deceptively simple. It often manifests as a shallow pool, its surface shimmering like brightly colored liquid, sometimes almost beautiful in its unnatural hues. In the right light, it can look like a harmless puddle, a splash of color in an otherwise dead landscape.</p>
<p>Contact strips away any illusions. Fruit Punch behaves like an extraordinarily corrosive acid, reacting the moment skin, fabric, or armor touches its surface. The damage is immediate and savage. Flesh blisters, peels, and dissolves within seconds, and even bone can begin to melt away under prolonged exposure. The injuries it leaves behind resemble chemical burns taken to an extreme—raw, weeping, and often unsurvivable without advanced medical care.</p>
<p>The true danger is its subtlety. Fruit Punch can sit inert for long stretches of time, appearing harmless until a small disturbance—an incautious step, a kicked stone, a dropped tool—wakes it. Scavengers are often caught off-guard, mistaking it for ordinary water or a muddy depression. By the time they realize their mistake, the damage has already begun.</p>
