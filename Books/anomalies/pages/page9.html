<h2 class="chapter-title">The Emission</h2>
<p>Emissions are not localized hazards but roaming catastrophes—massive, zone-wide events that roll across the landscape like a storm. They are most common in the heavily contaminated regions of Europe, where they occur frequently enough to shape the daily rhythms of survival. When an Emission is building, the world seems to sense it first: the sky darkens unnaturally fast, clouds boil together, and the air thickens with a palpable, electric tension. When the storm breaks, it does so with terrifying force. Emissions release intense waves of radiation, gravitational disturbances, and raw, destructive energy over vast areas. Those caught outside are often torn apart, burned, or irradiated beyond hope of recovery. Structures shudder as if struck by invisible impacts, and anything not built of heavy concrete, steel, or reinforced brick can crumble or fail. Even for those who find shelter, an Emission can leave a lingering mark—radiation sickness, neurological damage, or unexplained burns. Once the event passes, the world it leaves behind is not the same. Anomalies may reset, vanish, or reappear in new configurations. New artifacts and phenomena emerge where none existed before. Experienced survivors learn to read the subtle warning signs—aches in old injuries, sudden drops in temperature, odd shifts in the wind—and when they do, they run for the deepest, strongest cover they can find. There is no “riding out” an Emission in the open.</p>
