<h2 class="chapter-title">Lednik</h2>
<p>The Lednik anomaly forms in frozen regions, carving a section of the landscape into a jagged sculpture of death. It manifests as a field of razor-sharp ice spikes, many of them several meters tall, crowded together in dense, glittering clusters. The air in and around a Lednik zone is noticeably colder than the surrounding area, and a constant, cutting wind threads through the spikes, howling like a warning. The anomaly drains heat from its environment, plunging temperatures to levels that can induce frostbite within minutes. Hidden beneath the snow are unstable trigger points—shallow depressions or faint indentations visible only in good light. Step on one, and the ground erupts in a sudden surge of icy lances, stabbing upward with enough force to impale a fully armored explorer. The spikes are unnaturally hard and keen-edged, making survival unlikely for anyone caught directly above a trigger. In daylight, a trained eye can sometimes pick out the danger: subtle changes in the snow’s texture, regular patterns of shallow holes between the spikes. At night, those clues vanish, swallowed by darkness and drifting snow. Detectors often fail to register the traps, leaving even seasoned veterans effectively blind. Between the lethal cold and the hidden impalement hazards, Lednik anomalies turn already hostile frozen wastelands into near-certain killing fields for the unwary.</p>
