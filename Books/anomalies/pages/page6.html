<h2 class="chapter-title">The Vortex</h2>
<p>The Vortex is a gravitational anomaly of terrifying power. In daylight, its presence can sometimes be inferred from the subtle distortion of the air above it and the delicate swirl of dust and leaves circling an invisible center. The ground around it is almost never clean. Instead, it is marked by dark stains and grotesque remains, where previous victims have been torn apart and compressed into unrecognizable masses.</p>
<p>When triggered, the Vortex exerts a violent, focused pull over a wide radius—typically ten to fifteen meters, though larger instances have been recorded. Anything within that field, living or inanimate, is dragged inexorably toward the center. There is no fighting it and no outrunning it once you are caught. Those pulled in are crushed and twisted into dense lumps of flesh, bone, and metal before the anomaly discharges its energy in a brutal burst.</p>
<p>In darkness, the Vortex becomes almost impossible to spot, turning from a visible hazard into an invisible trap. Without strong detectors or the practice of tossing metal objects ahead as a test, travelers can walk straight into its kill zone without ever understanding what happened to them. Its combination of range, power, and instant lethality earns it a place among the most dreaded anomalies in the wasteland.</p>
