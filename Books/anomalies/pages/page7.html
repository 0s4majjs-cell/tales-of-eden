<h2 class="chapter-title">The Space Anomaly</h2>
<p>Also known as a Space Bubble, this anomaly offers no clear visual cue, no glowing halo or swirling dust to mark its boundaries. From the outside, the terrain looks completely ordinary. There are no ripples in the air, no unusual debris patterns, no environmental discoloration. The only real sign that you’ve stepped into one is a creeping sense that something is terribly wrong. Inside a Space Anomaly, the very structure of space seems bent and looped. No matter where you walk, you find yourself returning to the same point, tracing invisible circles through a warped fragment of reality. Maps don’t help. Compasses spin uselessly. Landmarks repeat in impossible sequences. Time begins to blur as days of walking feel like hours, and the mind starts to fray under the strain. The danger here is psychological as much as physical. Trapped in an invisible loop, victims are slowly worn down by exhaustion, dehydration, and growing panic. Many report hallucinations—figures in the distance, voices calling their name, glimpses of things that vanish when approached. Whether these are manifestations of the anomaly or the brain’s response to extreme stress is unknown. What is known is that many never find a way out, succumbing to despair or taking their own lives long before their bodies would have failed them naturally.</p>
