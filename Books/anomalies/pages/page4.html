<h2 class="chapter-title">The Springboard</h2>
<p>At a glance, a Springboard can look almost harmless. The air above it ripples gently, as if a breeze were rising from the ground. Leaves, dust, and small debris dance in a slow, spiraling drift over a patch of earth that never seems fully still. Around its perimeter, however, the ground is often stained dark—signs that those who misjudged their footing paid dearly for it.</p>
<p>The anomaly manipulates gravity in chaotic, unpredictable pulses. Step into its active zone and you might experience anything from a sudden, jarring shove to a brutal, crushing force. Some are tossed several meters into the air, slamming back down with broken bones and internal bleeding. Others are subjected to such intense gravitational compression that death comes in an instant, organs ruptured and bodies crushed.</p>
<p>Its randomness is what makes the Springboard so feared. There is no consistent pattern, no reliable way to gauge how it will behave from one moment to the next. Detecting it often requires specialized sensors, and even then, readings can be inconsistent. Experienced scavengers treat Springboard zones with extreme caution, knowing that a harmless-looking patch of wavering air can turn lethal with no warning.</p>
