<h2 class="chapter-title">The Time Machine</h2>
<p>The so-called Time Machine anomaly does not shine, roar, or tear bodies apart. It distorts something more subtle and arguably more terrifying: the flow of time itself. To the naked eye, it appears as a patch of strangely sluggish space. Within its boundaries, dust motes fall more slowly, leaves seem to drift in syrup, and the wind moves with an unnatural laziness. Sound can stretch and warp, as if someone were dragging their finger across the world’s playback speed. Inside the anomaly, time slows dramatically for anything caught within it. An explorer walking through might feel only a mild resistance, perhaps an odd sense of fatigue, but their internal perception of time remains mostly normal. Outside, however, minutes become hours, and hours can become days. From the perspective of observers, the trapped figure moves at a crawl, every step stretched into an agonizing, drawn-out motion. While the Time Machine does not inflict direct physical trauma, its consequences are often deadly. The slowed movement makes it nearly impossible to escape once fully inside, turning every attempt to leave into a drawn-out struggle. Victims have been found desiccated, frozen mid-step, their bodies locked in poses of effort or confusion—evidence that they died of thirst, hunger, or environmental exposure while they believed only a short time had passed. The disconnect between internal and external time is what makes this anomaly so insidious: by the time anyone realizes what is happening, it is usually far too late.</p>
