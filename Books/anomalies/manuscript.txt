# The Burner

Inactive, the Burner is almost nothing—just a faint shimmer in the air, a distortion like heat waves rising from sun-baked asphalt. It blends into the landscape so well that most people walk past it without ever knowing how close they came. Only at night, when the world dims and the contrast sharpens, or through the lens of specialized detectors, does the anomaly become easier to pick out.

Once triggered by a living being or an object entering its radius, the transformation is instant. The air inside the anomaly flashes to temperatures of up to 3000°C (5432°F), heat so intense it doesn’t burn so much as erase. Anything caught in that space is reduced to ash in a heartbeat. Metal hurled into a Burner will first glow white-hot, deform, and then crumble away—one of the only safe ways to test for its presence without stepping into oblivion.

Because of the extreme temperatures, some scavengers attempt to “farm” Burners, using their heat to fuse or refine rare materials. Few walk away unscathed. Even a moment of misjudgment can mean melted gear, fused armor, or the collapse of protective equipment, and the superheated air can cook flesh and bone long before a person understands what’s happening.

  

# Fruit Punch

The anomaly known as Fruit Punch is small and deceptively simple. It often manifests as a shallow pool, its surface shimmering like brightly colored liquid, sometimes almost beautiful in its unnatural hues. In the right light, it can look like a harmless puddle, a splash of color in an otherwise dead landscape.

Contact strips away any illusions. Fruit Punch behaves like an extraordinarily corrosive acid, reacting the moment skin, fabric, or armor touches its surface. The damage is immediate and savage. Flesh blisters, peels, and dissolves within seconds, and even bone can begin to melt away under prolonged exposure. The injuries it leaves behind resemble chemical burns taken to an extreme—raw, weeping, and often unsurvivable without advanced medical care.

The true danger is its subtlety. Fruit Punch can sit inert for long stretches of time, appearing harmless until a small disturbance—an incautious step, a kicked stone, a dropped tool—wakes it. Scavengers are often caught off-guard, mistaking it for ordinary water or a muddy depression. By the time they realize their mistake, the damage has already begun.



# The Electro

Electro anomalies tend to cluster around the relics of humanity’s old power—abandoned plants, ruined substations, derelict cities threaded with dead cables. They appear as a bluish haze or a shimmering knot of air, hanging low over the ground or coiling lazily between broken structures. In daylight, they can be picked out by their unnatural stillness; at night, they betray themselves with tiny blue sparks, a miniature storm trapped in place.

When disturbed, an Electro discharges violently, unleashing a storm of miniature lightning strikes in every direction. These bolts don’t just sting—they kill. The electrical surge is strong enough to stop a heart in an instant, cook nerves, and overload cybernetics or powered armor from the inside out. Even a “weak” discharge is often fatal at close range.

The anomaly is drawn to metal and active electronics, making anyone carrying weapons, tools, or advanced gear especially vulnerable. While many Electros can be avoided in clear daylight, in dark spaces, storms, or cramped ruins, they become far harder to see and far more deadly. Survivors often report hearing their last warning as a faint crackle—right before everything goes white.

  

# The Springboard

At a glance, a Springboard can look almost harmless. The air above it ripples gently, as if a breeze were rising from the ground. Leaves, dust, and small debris dance in a slow, spiraling drift over a patch of earth that never seems fully still. Around its perimeter, however, the ground is often stained dark—signs that those who misjudged their footing paid dearly for it.

The anomaly manipulates gravity in chaotic, unpredictable pulses. Step into its active zone and you might experience anything from a sudden, jarring shove to a brutal, crushing force. Some are tossed several meters into the air, slamming back down with broken bones and internal bleeding. Others are subjected to such intense gravitational compression that death comes in an instant, organs ruptured and bodies crushed.

Its randomness is what makes the Springboard so feared. There is no consistent pattern, no reliable way to gauge how it will behave from one moment to the next. Detecting it often requires specialized sensors, and even then, readings can be inconsistent. Experienced scavengers treat Springboard zones with extreme caution, knowing that a harmless-looking patch of wavering air can turn lethal with no warning.

  

# The Whirligig

A Whirligig announces itself with motion: a small, continuous whirlwind of dust, ash, and debris turning lazily above the ground. It looks weak, almost fragile, but the area around it tells the truth. Scattered equipment, torn clothing, and occasionally dismembered body parts lie strewn in its vicinity, grim evidence of what happens when the anomaly is triggered.

Once activated, the Whirligig becomes a concentrated vortex of violent air currents. Anything within its radius—stones, weapons, entire bodies—is snatched off the ground and dragged into a chaotic spin. Those caught near the fringes may be battered, thrown, or left with broken bones and lacerations. Those pulled toward the center face far worse. The forces involved can wrench limbs from sockets, tear bodies apart, and shred flesh against flying debris.

In open spaces, the Whirligig is terrifying enough. In enclosed environments—ruined buildings, tunnels, collapsed industrial sites—its lethality increases dramatically. With nowhere to escape and walls to ricochet off, victims are often flung repeatedly into hard surfaces until there is little left to recognize.

  

# The Vortex

The Vortex is a gravitational anomaly of terrifying power. In daylight, its presence can sometimes be inferred from the subtle distortion of the air above it and the delicate swirl of dust and leaves circling an invisible center. The ground around it is almost never clean. Instead, it is marked by dark stains and grotesque remains, where previous victims have been torn apart and compressed into unrecognizable masses.

When triggered, the Vortex exerts a violent, focused pull over a wide radius—typically ten to fifteen meters, though larger instances have been recorded. Anything within that field, living or inanimate, is dragged inexorably toward the center. There is no fighting it and no outrunning it once you are caught. Those pulled in are crushed and twisted into dense lumps of flesh, bone, and metal before the anomaly discharges its energy in a brutal burst.

In darkness, the Vortex becomes almost impossible to spot, turning from a visible hazard into an invisible trap. Without strong detectors or the practice of tossing metal objects ahead as a test, travelers can walk straight into its kill zone without ever understanding what happened to them. Its combination of range, power, and instant lethality earns it a place among the most dreaded anomalies in the wasteland.

  

# The Space Anomaly

Also known as a Space Bubble, this anomaly offers no clear visual cue, no glowing halo or swirling dust to mark its boundaries. From the outside, the terrain looks completely ordinary. There are no ripples in the air, no unusual debris patterns, no environmental discoloration. The only real sign that you’ve stepped into one is a creeping sense that something is terribly wrong. Inside a Space Anomaly, the very structure of space seems bent and looped. No matter where you walk, you find yourself returning to the same point, tracing invisible circles through a warped fragment of reality. Maps don’t help. Compasses spin uselessly. Landmarks repeat in impossible sequences. Time begins to blur as days of walking feel like hours, and the mind starts to fray under the strain. The danger here is psychological as much as physical. Trapped in an invisible loop, victims are slowly worn down by exhaustion, dehydration, and growing panic. Many report hallucinations—figures in the distance, voices calling their name, glimpses of things that vanish when approached. Whether these are manifestations of the anomaly or the brain’s response to extreme stress is unknown. What is known is that many never find a way out, succumbing to despair or taking their own lives long before their bodies would have failed them naturally.

  

# The Gascon

Gascon anomalies are chemical nightmares—zones where the air itself becomes a weapon. In open terrain, they can usually be identified by thick, roiling mists and the glistening pools of corrosive liquid that bubble and spit at their feet. The air around them often carries a sharp, acidic stench that burns in the throat and nose, signaling danger even before visual confirmation.

The anomaly constantly generates toxic gases and highly corrosive acids. The liquid it produces can strip flesh from bone in seconds, leaving behind raw, eaten tissue and exposed skeleton. The gases are equally lethal, attacking the lungs and respiratory system, causing internal burns, suffocation, and rapid organ failure. Even brief exposure without proper protective gear can result in permanent damage or death.

In enclosed spaces—tunnels, bunkers, underground facilities—the Gascon becomes truly devastating. The fumes pool and spread rapidly, filling low places and creeping through cracks. Visibility drops, detectors can become unreliable, and a single misstep can plunge an unsuspecting explorer into a pocket of concentrated toxin. In such conditions, a Gascon can wipe out an entire group before they even understand what they’ve walked into.

  

# The Emission

Emissions are not localized hazards but roaming catastrophes—massive, zone-wide events that roll across the landscape like a storm. They are most common in the heavily contaminated regions of Europe, where they occur frequently enough to shape the daily rhythms of survival. When an Emission is building, the world seems to sense it first: the sky darkens unnaturally fast, clouds boil together, and the air thickens with a palpable, electric tension. When the storm breaks, it does so with terrifying force. Emissions release intense waves of radiation, gravitational disturbances, and raw, destructive energy over vast areas. Those caught outside are often torn apart, burned, or irradiated beyond hope of recovery. Structures shudder as if struck by invisible impacts, and anything not built of heavy concrete, steel, or reinforced brick can crumble or fail. Even for those who find shelter, an Emission can leave a lingering mark—radiation sickness, neurological damage, or unexplained burns. Once the event passes, the world it leaves behind is not the same. Anomalies may reset, vanish, or reappear in new configurations. New artifacts and phenomena emerge where none existed before. Experienced survivors learn to read the subtle warning signs—aches in old injuries, sudden drops in temperature, odd shifts in the wind—and when they do, they run for the deepest, strongest cover they can find. There is no “riding out” an Emission in the open.

  

# The Lift

The Lift anomaly is a rare oddity in a world that mostly wants you dead. Unlike most of its counterparts, it does not directly maim or destroy on contact. It manifests as a patch of space where gravity weakens or vanishes altogether. To casual observation, it can be nearly invisible. Only the occasional floating leaf, drifting speck of dust, or slowly rising scrap of debris hints at the change. Step into its field, and the body grows light. Equipment tugs gently upward. A careless jump can send a person drifting into open air, flailing as the usual rules of weight and motion no longer apply. For a brief moment, the Lift can feel almost miraculous—a reprieve from the constant drag of fatigue and heavy gear. The danger lies not in the anomaly itself, but in what surrounds it. Objects that were previously pinned to the ground—rubble, scrap metal, broken beams—can be suspended overhead. When the anomaly collapses or changes phase without warning, everything it was holding aloft comes crashing down. Anyone trapped underneath becomes an easy target for falling debris, and rescuing them is often impossible in time. In hostile territory, a disabled scavenger pinned under a pile of rubble is simply prey waiting to be claimed.

  

# The Time Machine

The so-called Time Machine anomaly does not shine, roar, or tear bodies apart. It distorts something more subtle and arguably more terrifying: the flow of time itself. To the naked eye, it appears as a patch of strangely sluggish space. Within its boundaries, dust motes fall more slowly, leaves seem to drift in syrup, and the wind moves with an unnatural laziness. Sound can stretch and warp, as if someone were dragging their finger across the world’s playback speed. Inside the anomaly, time slows dramatically for anything caught within it. An explorer walking through might feel only a mild resistance, perhaps an odd sense of fatigue, but their internal perception of time remains mostly normal. Outside, however, minutes become hours, and hours can become days. From the perspective of observers, the trapped figure moves at a crawl, every step stretched into an agonizing, drawn-out motion. While the Time Machine does not inflict direct physical trauma, its consequences are often deadly. The slowed movement makes it nearly impossible to escape once fully inside, turning every attempt to leave into a drawn-out struggle. Victims have been found desiccated, frozen mid-step, their bodies locked in poses of effort or confusion—evidence that they died of thirst, hunger, or environmental exposure while they believed only a short time had passed. The disconnect between internal and external time is what makes this anomaly so insidious: by the time anyone realizes what is happening, it is usually far too late.

  

# Lednik

The Lednik anomaly forms in frozen regions, carving a section of the landscape into a jagged sculpture of death. It manifests as a field of razor-sharp ice spikes, many of them several meters tall, crowded together in dense, glittering clusters. The air in and around a Lednik zone is noticeably colder than the surrounding area, and a constant, cutting wind threads through the spikes, howling like a warning. The anomaly drains heat from its environment, plunging temperatures to levels that can induce frostbite within minutes. Hidden beneath the snow are unstable trigger points—shallow depressions or faint indentations visible only in good light. Step on one, and the ground erupts in a sudden surge of icy lances, stabbing upward with enough force to impale a fully armored explorer. The spikes are unnaturally hard and keen-edged, making survival unlikely for anyone caught directly above a trigger. In daylight, a trained eye can sometimes pick out the danger: subtle changes in the snow’s texture, regular patterns of shallow holes between the spikes. At night, those clues vanish, swallowed by darkness and drifting snow. Detectors often fail to register the traps, leaving even seasoned veterans effectively blind. Between the lethal cold and the hidden impalement hazards, Lednik anomalies turn already hostile frozen wastelands into near-certain killing fields for the unwary.
